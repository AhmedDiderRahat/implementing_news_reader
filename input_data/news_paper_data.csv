3074331,Consumer rights body’s oil price monitoring starts tomorrow,19-07-2022,/business/news/consumer-rights-bodys-oil-price-monitoring-starts-tomorrow-3074331,business,"The Directorate of National Consumer Rights Protection (DNCRP) will start monitoring the market from tomorrow to ensure that no trader can sale edible oil at prices higher than the newly reduced rates, which come into effect on July 18. The consumer rights body took the decision at the third meeting of the National Market Monitoring Taskforce as a section of traders are still selling the cooking oil at the previous high prices. Tapan Kanti Ghosh, head of the committee and senior commerce secretary, chaired the meeting held at his office in the secretariat in Dhaka today. On July 17, the government reduced bottled soybean oil's retail price by Tk 14 a litre. The new price, Tk 185, was supposed to come from July 18. The price of palm oil was reduced by Tk 6 a litre to Tk 152. However, the retailers, millers and refiners are yet to follow the new prices of the edible oil and still selling at the previous high prices in the local markets. ""So, we have decided that the officers of the (DNCRP) will vigil the markets so that the retailers, milers and refiners cannot sell edible oil at the previous rates as the prices have already been reduced,"" Ghosh told The Daily Star over phone after the meeting. The commerce secretary also said the government may reduce the edible oil prices in the local market substantially soon as the global prices of the cooking oil have reduced significantly. In the taskforce meeting, the commerce ministry also has decided to write to the National Board of Revenue to reduce duty on import of canola and sunflower oil to increase the diversity of the edible oil in the market, he said."

A high-powered visiting EU delegation conveyed the message in a meeting with the senior officials of commerce, labour and foreign ministries in Dhaka today. The NAP is a roadmap of the Bangladesh government to address the challenges of the LDC graduation which is supposed to be implemented by 2026. Meanwhile, the EU's Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP +) gives developing countries a special incentive to pursue sustainable development and good governance. The six-member EU trade committee led by Heidi Hautala held the meeting with the officials of the three ministries at the Foreign Service Academy to assess the country's labour and human rights and the workplace safety issues. Tapan Kanti Ghosh, senior secretary to the commerce ministry, led Bangladesh's side in the meeting. The EU has been putting pressure on Bangladesh over the last few years to amend the labour law and make a uniform law for both the workers at Export Processing Zones (EPZs) and outside of the EPZs. Currently, the labour law allows full freedom of forming unions of the workers outside of the EPZs but the workers of the EPZ factories have the Workers' Participation Committee. So, the EU has been suggesting the government for amending the labour law and making a single law for all workers for obtaining the GSP Plus."

Since September last year, 3,224 new complaints were filed against the platform and no complaints were resolved, according to data of the Directorate of National Consumer Rights Protection (DNCRP). E-orange founder Sonia Mehjabin and several of its officials have been in jail since their arrest on August 16 last year on charge of embezzling Tk 1,100 crore of customers. Sheikh Sohel Rana, the so-called patron of the e-commerce platform, has fled the country. Of the victims, around a year has passed since Arif Anwari, a freelancer who made advance payments of about Tk 9 lakh to E-orange for motorcycles and other products, filed a complaint with the DNCRP. But his complaints have not been resolved. An official of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) said the department had recently concluded that E-orange officials laundered over Tk 230 crore abroad. Asked why the customers' complaints are not getting resolved, AHM Shafiquzzaman, director general at the DNCRP, said the directorate calls the officials of the companies for hearing to resolve complaints.

A total of 10,747 complaints have so far been filed against Evaly and only 4,495 were settled as of June this year, according to the DNCRP. This took the settlement rate of the controversial platform to 41 per cent as of June this year, which was 84 per cent a year earlier. The probability of getting back money for Evaly's customers is particularly low as it has a huge amount of liabilities to customers and merchants but only has a limited amount of assets. For example, a sum of Tk 25 crore of Evaly is now stuck in escrow accounts of different payment gateways and the e-commerce platform has goods worth Tk 25 crore in two of its warehouses at present, according to a court-instituted board. Justice AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury Manik, who leads the board, recently said this amount was a ""drop in the ocean"" compared to the claims made against the company. Asked about the fall in the rate of complaints being resolved, AHM Shafiquzzaman, director general at the DNCRP, said the directorate calls the officials of the companies for hearing to resolve complaints. But offices of many of such e-commerce platforms have shut down and there is no trace of their officials, he said. ""The maximum number of complaints are against Evaly. There is no one to refund the money."" Mahbub Kabir Milon, managing director of Evaly appointed by the court, said the court has given them specific instruction to conduct an audit and give an opinion about whether the company should run or dissolve.

""We have concerns over human rights abuses like the extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, shrinking civic space and so on,"" said leader of the delegation, Heidi Hautala who is also Vice-President of the European Parliament, at the DCAB Talk at National Press Club today (July 19, 2022). She said Bangladesh has a labour road map and now it is high time that the authorities implement it. She also spoke about the trade union rights that need to be ensured in the export processing zones. The good thing is that Bangladesh has promised to ensure trade union rights in the EPZs, she said. Hautala also said that Bangladesh must end child labour by 2025 as it prepares to get GSP Plus. She also spoke of amending the Digital Security Act that has negative impacts on media and the right to freedom of speech. EU is the largest export destination of Bangladesh. The export increased from euro 9 billion to euro 19 billion in 2019. EU has been providing duty-free and quota-free access to Bangladesh. As Bangladesh graduates out of LDC, the facility will go away. However, the country can be eligible under the new privilege, GSP Plus, but that will require stringent conditions like improving human rights and labour rights. The EU delegation is visiting Bangladesh to assess the country's situation. The trade committee led by Heidi Hautala includes José Manuel García-Margallo, Sven Simon, Agnes Jongerius, Jordi Cañas and Maximilian Krah, according to a statement of the European Parliament."

3073741,Implementing public interest projects,19-07-2022,/business/economy/news/implementing-public-interest-projects-3073741,business,"Like in any other developing country, all public interest projects in Bangladesh are supposed to be well thought out with their ultimate impacts reviewed. However, courtesy of the media, even the state investigation agencies, we mostly don't get to hear good things about projects being well-researched, the ultimate impact on the target market or group well-thought out, finance being well-managed or done with sincerity of purpose. Most project plans are haphazardly initiated, project directors are not experienced and there is an absence of proper financial modelling leading to cost escalation. Effective project planning in public interest projects can play an important role to overcome these issues. An effective project plan not only boosts project performance but also ensures the efficient utilisation of the resources to save costs. Project cost management plays a very important role in managing and controlling the flow of cost. Proper management can decrease expenses, improve operational efficiency, and ensure procurement effectiveness Project cost management plays a very important role in managing and controlling the flow of cost. Proper management can decrease expenses, improve operational efficiency, and ensure procurement effectiveness It's a common belief that we have an execution problem when it comes to projects. Very few public interest projects finish on time, and fewer still without their costs escalating to a significant level. This is perhaps the biggest hazard to tax-paying citizens who want to get their money's worth from the large pool of projects launched around the year. Project cost overruns are one of the common elements behind the failure of every four out of five projects. So, project cost management plays a very important role in managing and controlling the flow of cost for various resources in different tasks of the project. Proper project cost management can decrease expenses, improve operational efficiency, and ensure procurement effectiveness. The lack of good governance in project implementation is undermining the efficiency of public infrastructure projects despite the huge money from the exchequer or development partners being invested. In order to ensure return on investment and the right levels of structure & accountability, effective project governance must be ensured. More importantly, project governance enables quicker data-backed decision-making through data and enables effective monitoring. Projects are often undertaken without any feasibility study, which is a fundamental requirement, thus necessitating a series of revisions at frequent intervals. This is, unfortunately, the story of many other projects as well, and it's surprising that those at the planning ministry still give clearance to those. The absence of a feasibility study is just as bad as the presence of a weak feasibility study, both of which are common. It's the first and perhaps most recurring factor in poorly planned undertakings. So, conducting a feasibility study before undertaking any big-ticket public interest project not only provides valuable information for a ""go/no go"" decision, but also identifies reasons why the project should not proceed and innovative solutions that would make the project feasible. Other problems identified in the public interest projects include coordination failure, delays in land acquisition, frequent changes of project directors and unqualified project directors, etc. Ad-hoc decisions or mismanagement is the running theme behind all such obstacles. Delays can also trigger a chain of costly disruptions. In most cases, the failure of a project is mainly related to the influence of planners, contractors and owners on project performance. Effects of delays are costly to all parties concerned and very often it will result in disagreements, cost overruns and project infeasibility. We have noticed such disruptions, delays or regular excess payment claimed by the contractors while implementing the Dhaka-Chittagong four lane road, Dhaka-Sylhet highway, Dhaka-Mymensingh double lanes, VAT online project at NBR, digitalisation project at ACC or even the much talked about Padma Bridge project. There are plenty of other projects with important ministries carrying the proof of a similar saga. One can easily ask- is there no institutional mechanism to check such systemic problems and disappointments? Everyone wants the government to establish accountability to ensure that all its projects are planned and executed properly. Ill-conceived projects not just push us to bleed financially, but also potentially deprive us of their desired benefits. This has been going on for so long, and it is the common people who have or had to pay for it. The government must ensure there is a minimum threshold, both of experience and qualification, for project directors before anyone is appointed. It should be clear ""where the buck stops"" as someone must be held responsible for cost overruns and delays. Project costs should be clearly committed to with an inflation component built in and agreement from all parties on a particular set of allowances for inclement circumstances which are out of control. There should be a report format, akin to the customer acquisition form at banks, where the details of a feasibility study are provided and this must be submitted to the ministry concerned, with the firm/people who carried out the study responsible for any negligence or failure they may reasonably be expected to predict. The projects' feasibility also depends on all these moving parts working in sync with each other and so the project viability must be assessed with these concepts in mind. The project director must be the sole authority on the project once work commences and any replacement of the project director must be transparent and any failures on the part of the project director publicly acknowledged. Many years ago, the government was thinking of a ""project management cadre"" under Bangladesh Civil Service also. Project conception or planning, commercial, financial, or even social and environmental due diligence, financial model, implementation monitoring, procurement, compensation to affected parties and payback as per the plan - all require competency in the respective agency and precision to implement. All this requires congenial policy regime and accountability driven from the top. The author is an economic analyst. Views expressed here are personal."
3073751,Tea production expands but exports decline,19-07-2022,/business/economy/news/tea-production-expands-exports-decline-3073751,business,"Although tea production has expanded in Bangladesh over the past decade, outbound shipments of the once major export earner have dropped at the same time in the face of growing domestic demand, according to market players. As consumption is growing in line with the country's expanding population and urbanisation, tea production has increased over the years to cater to local markets rather than those abroad, they said. Besides, another reason is that local prices are comparatively better compared to that of the international market. Omar Hannan, chairman of the Tea Traders Association of Bangladesh, said local consumption rises by 6-7 per cent every year and if domestic production cannot cope, then tea would have to be imported to make up for the dearth in supply. ""So, the export decline is not a demerit,"" he added. Large amounts of tea go up for auction at the end of each harvesting season but nothing remains unsold, meaning that exports can only increase when there is surplus in production. ""Conversely, if there was a lot of tea left over after catering to local demand and it is not exported, then that would be a matter of concern,"" Hannan said. According to the Bangladesh Tea Board (BTB), tea is currently exported from Bangladesh to 23 countries, including the US, UK, France, China, Japan, India and Switzerland. Nader Khan, founder of the Halda Valley Tea Company, said Bangladesh's economic growth has been quite good in the last decade and as a result, country's tea consumption has increased. ""Due to this, production increases every year but exports are not increasing,"" he said, adding that different blends are still imported to suit varying tastes. Sources say that a little less than one million kilogrammes (kgs) of tea is imported every year for various reasons, particularly rising consumption. ""Annual tea consumption may shoot up to 130 million kgs by 2025,"" said Munir Ahmad, deputy director for planning of the BTB. BTB data shows that about 96.51 million kgs of tea was produced in 2021, up by some 54 per cent compared to 62.52 million kgs in 2012. The country earned $2.44 million from tea exports in fiscal 2012-13 and then $4.47 million in fiscal 2016-17. However, foreign currency earnings from the product dropped to $2.14 million in the last fiscal year, according to the Export Promotion Bureau. BTB sources say that Bangladesh was the world's fifth highest tea exporting country back in the 1990s, when international demand was high considering the good quality of local blends. At that time, tea was at the top of the export list for Bangladesh. An official of the Bangladesh Tea Research Institute said that in 1947, 18 million kgs of tea was produced in the erstwhile East Pakistan. Of the total amount, 15 million kgs were exported. Then in the 1970s, tea production rose to about 31 million kgs per year, a large portion of which was still exported, and this trend continued until the 1990s, he added. While speaking at the recent National Tea Day programme, Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi said that there is demand for Bangladesh's tea in the global market as the quality is good. However, he added that it is not possible to export as much tea as expected. In Bangladesh, 45 per cent of the tea produced is consumed at the household level while the rest at tea stalls, restaurants, and offices. Tea is a part of social and professional life in the country, making it one of the most-consumed beverages and it is popular among low-income groups as well. Local tea brands dominate the domestic market with a 75 per cent share while non-branded producers account for the rest. According to the Bangladesh Tea Association, the 166 tea estates in the country cover almost 280,000 acres of land. Bangladesh is currently listed as the world's ninth largest tea producer, accounting for around 2 per cent of the world's total production. In addition, 90 of the tea gardens are currently in Moulvibazar, which accounts for 55 per cent of the tea produced in the country. Habiganj is the second largest producing district, contributing 22 per cent."
3073746,Oil price jumps,19-07-2022,/business/global-economy/news/oil-price-jumps-3073746,business,"Oil prices extended gains on Monday, propped up by a weaker dollar and tight supplies that offset concerns about recession and the prospect of widespread Covid-19 lockdowns in China again reducing fuel demand. Brent crude futures for September settlement rose $2.44, or 2.4 per cent, to $103.60 a barrel by 0900 GMT, having advanced by 2.1 per cent on Friday. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures for August delivery gained $2.17, or 2.2 per cent, to $99.76 after rising by 1.9 per cent in the previous session. Both Brent and WTI last week registered their biggest weekly declines for about a month on fears of a recession that would hit oil demand. Mass Covid-testing exercises continue in parts of China this week, raising concerns over oil demand from the world's second-largest oil consumer. However, oil supplies remain tight. As expected, US President Joe Biden's trip to Saudi Arabia failed to yield any pledge from the top OPEC producer to boost oil supply. Biden wants Gulf oil producers to step up output to help to lower oil prices and drive down inflation. Global markets are focused this week on the resumption of Russian gas flows to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which is scheduled to end maintenance on July 21. Governments, markets and companies fear the shutdown could be extended because of the war in Ukraine. ""Brent crude will find support at the end of the week if Russia does not turn the gas back on to Germany after Nord Stream 1 maintenance,"" said OANDA senior analyst Jeffrey Halley. Loss of that gas to Germany, the world's fourth-largest economy, would hit it hard and heighten the risk of recession."
3073736,ECB goes on offensive as inflation soars ,19-07-2022,/business/global-economy/news/ecb-goes-offensive-inflation-soars-3073736,business,"The European Central Bank will raise its interest rates on Thursday for the first time in over a decade, but the bank is already under pressure to do more amid record inflation. The ECB has for months been preparing the end of the era of cheap money that supported the economy through a series of crises in recent years. To try and counteract a steep rise in prices the central bank has said it intends to raise its interest rates by a quarter point, the first such move since 2011. The ECB already stopped its bond-buying stimulus programme at the beginning of July, as it laid the groundwork for the rise. The lift-off in rates comes in response to an unprecedented surge in prices, driven higher by supply chain bottlenecks and the rising cost of energy following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Inflation in the eurozone sat at 8.6 per cent in June, the highest ever recorded for the currency club and well above the ECB's two-per cent target. The Frankfurt-based institution continues playing catch up with its peers, like the US Federal Reserve, which started hiking earlier and more aggressively. The ECB deposit rate has been negative for the past eight years, with the key rate currently at minus 0.5 per cent. The punitive interest rate, which effectively charges banks to park their money with the ECB overnight, was designed to encourage more lending, more economic activity and higher inflation rates. Stubbornly low for years, prices are now soaring as a result of scrambled supply chains from the coronavirus pandemic and the burst in the price of food and energy caused by the war in Ukraine. The inflation surge caught central banks, not least the ECB, off guard. Now, the central bank is aiming is to lift interest rates out of negative territory by the end of September as part of a  ""gradual but sustained"" series of hikes, according to President Christine Lagarde. In hindsight, the  ""cautious normalisation process the ECB started at the end of last year has simply been too slow and too late,"" said Carsten Brzeski, head of macro at the ING bank. With each new data release causing new consternation, the ECB's cautious quarter-point step could lead to a feeling of  ""disappointment"", Brzeski said. Some ECB policymakers may push for faster action but  ""it will be a balancing act between the ECB's credibility as being predictable and its credibility as a determined inflation fighter,"" he said. The ECB was faced with an  ""impossible equation to solve"", said Frederik Ducrozet, head of macroeconomic research at Pictet Wealth Management. Central bankers were determined to squash inflation while  ""the euro area economy is on the brink of recession"", circumstances under which they would normally hesitate to raise interest rates. The outlook for the economy was clouded by the war in Ukraine with eurozone members bracing for a winter in which energy could be scarce and planning to ration supplies if Russia halts gas deliveries to the continent. Add a weak euro against the dollar, which touched parity recently for the first time in nearly 20 years, and a political crisis in Italy and the monetary calculations became even harder, Ducrozet said. The withdrawal of a key party from former ECB chief and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi's governing coalition has unnerved investors, sending borrowing costs up again. The quickly rising strain in bond markets had already prompted the ECB to respond in mid-June by speeding up the design of an instrument to fight  ""fragmentation"" in the eurozone. The new tool was  ""critical"" to avoid  ""excessive divergence"" in the borrowing costs faced by different countries and make sure monetary policy moves were felt evenly across the eurozone, ECB vice-president Luis de Guindos said in early July. But the idea has been met with scepticism by some governing council members. Any crisis tool should only be used in  ""exceptional circumstances"" and under strict conditions, warned Joachim Nagel, head of the traditionally conservative German Bundesbank."
3073731,Fashion retailer H&M to exit Russia,19-07-2022,/business/global-economy/news/fashion-retailer-hm-exit-russia-3073731,business,"H&M, the world's second-biggest fashion retailer, said on Monday it had decided to wind down its business in Russia, joining a growing list of companies fully exiting the country and sending its shares down 1 per cent. The company suspended its business in Russia in early March in the wake of Western sanctions against Moscow following its invasion of Ukraine. Russia was H&M's sixth biggest market and the company was increasing its store count there while reducing physical stores in many other markets. ""After careful consideration, we see it as impossible given the current situation to continue our business in Russia,"" Chief Executive Helena Helmersson said in a statement. ""We are deeply saddened about the impact this will have on our colleagues,"" Helmersson said but did not elaborate. A company spokesperson said about 6,000 employees in the country would be affected. The entire wind-down is expected to cost about 2 billion Swedish crowns ($191.3 million), of which about 1 billion crowns will have a cash flow impact, H&M said.

The European Central Bank is set to raise rates for the first time in more than a decade on Thursday, the same day the bloc will be hoping Russia resumes gas supplies. Italy, meanwhile, is again in the grip of a political crisis. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 1.3 per cent by 1030 GMT after posting a 0.8 per cent drop last week.

It came too as the high-flying dollar, which has had its strongest start to a year in recent memory, eased on Monday. The uncertainty will haunt the ECB at a policy meeting where it is likely to kick off a tightening cycle with a rise of 25 bps, with markets hanging on details of an anti-fragmentation tool intended to ease pressure on borrowing costs for the Union's most indebted members. Friday's rally on Wall Street reverberated through global markets with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan up 1.4 per cent, having shed 3.5 per cent last week. A wider index of global stocks was up 0.4 per cent.

The former Real Madrid star has apparently adopted a new routine to maintain his eternal youth. While most of the credit for physique can be attributed to his diet, workouts regimen and great genetics, touch-ups and new advances in surgery also allow him to keep his muscles healthy and young. It is no secret that Ronaldo is a fan of cosmetic operations. Botox is undoubtedly the Portuguese's greatest ally: while his face has already undergone several treatments, it is not the only part of his body that has received a Botox injection. According to La Razon, Ronaldo also had Botox injections in his private parts, more precisely in his penis. The purpose of these injections is to increase the thickness of the penis by anywhere between one, two or three centimetres, and can last up to two years, is reversible and does not require stitches, although it is not a treatment that is guaranteed to work.

The 25-year-old three-time Grand Slam winner stunned the sporting world with her bombshell retirement in March, just weeks after becoming the first home Australian Open champion in 44 years. Barty had been coy on what she would do next, but has always been a keen golfer, winning the Brookwater Golf Club women's title near Brisbane in 2020 and playing the Icons Series exhibition in the United States in April. It heightened speculation that the multi-talented Australian, who has also been a professional cricketer, could take up golf seriously. But in an interview with Melbourne radio late Monday she put the rumours to bed, ruling out playing any form of professional sport again. ""You guys just can't accept that I don't want to play professional sport any more,"" Barty said. ""I love golf, it's a hobby of mine. It will not be my profession, I have no intention of making it my profession but I hack around once a week if I can.

3074326,Martial on target as United beat Palace,19-07-2022,/sports/football/news/martial-target-united-beat-palace-3074326,sports,"New coach Erik ten Hag said his players' belief was improving after Anthony Martial scored his third goal in three games as a slick Manchester United beat Crystal Palace 3-1 on Tuesday. In front of 76,500 fans at Melbourne Cricket Ground, French forward Martial struck in the first half while Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho both collected their second goals of the pre-season tour after the restart. Joel Ward pulled one back for Palace, but they were always chasing a game that saw United reduced to 10 men in the dying minutes after Will Fish was sent off for a deliberate foul. The friendly victory was Ten Hag's third since taking over after their 4-0 thumping of Liverpool in Bangkok and a 4-1 win over Melbourne Victory. In contrast, it was a second straight defeat for Patrick Vieira's young Palace side, who crashed 2-0 to Liverpool in Singapore on Friday. ""We are happy with the improvement we are seeing, but there is also a lot of work to do,"" said Ten Hag. ""We did score some wonderful goals, that's true. ""We played well and I think the belief is increasing,"" he added while praising his forwards in particular. ""They did a lot of running, a lot of work. They have a lot of energy and were rewarded by scoring goals."" The Dutchman is beginning to stamp his mark on the Old Trafford side, with his team -- who finished a disappointing sixth last season in the Premier League -- producing some fluid, one-touch football. Goalkeeper David de Gea returned after missing the Victory game with a niggle. New left-back Tyrell Malacia began ahead of Luke Shaw, while Rashford was back in the starting line-up after scoring as a substitute against Victory, partnering a rejuvenated Martial and Sancho in Cristiano Ronaldo's absence. Christian Eriksen and Lisandro Martinez, Ten Hag's other new signings, are not in Australia. Vieira has a youthful squad in Australia, with a number of senior players not making the trip. Hungry for goals United made a confident start, dominating early possession, with Palace goalkeeper Jack Butland making a fine stop from Martial after Brazilian Fred's pass split the defence. But the save ended Butland's game, forcing him to leave the pitch after treatment on his hand. The 26-year-old Martial -- whose career at United looked over after spending the end of last season on loan at Sevilla -- got the breakthrough seven minutes later. He chested down a wonderful floating delivery from Diogo Dalot to fire past Palace's third-choice keeper Remi Matthews after a well-worked build-up. United were hungry for goals, creating plenty of opportunities with Harry Maguire and Rashford both going close. Against Liverpool and Victory, Ten Hag made wholesale changes at half-time, but this time he made just one, with Donny van de Beek on for Scott McTominay. Van de Beek was involved in the second goal, with a sublime team move finished by Rashford tapping into an empty net. Sancho got the third soon after on a counter-attack with Martial providing the through ball. United head to Perth next to play Steven Gerrard's Aston Villa, who beat Leeds 1-0 to kickstart their pre-season. Palace also travel to Perth, to face Leeds."

Pakistan ended day four on 222 for three, still needing 120 runs to take the lead in the two-match series at Galle, where the highest successful fourth-innings chase is 268 by Sri Lanka against New Zealand in 2019. Shafique, batting on 112, and skipper Babar Azam, who made 55, put together 101 runs for the third wicket but spinner Prabath Jayasuriya broke through just a few overs before the close of play. Jayasuriya bowled talisman Azam with his left-arm spin around the batsman's legs with a delivery that spun sharply from outside leg to rattle the stumps of the right-hander, who looked visibly shocked. Wicketkeeper-batsman Mohammad Rizwan was batting on seven at stumps alongside Shafique, who had so far faced 289 balls and hit five boundaries and one six. Pakistan began strongly with a 87-run partnership between Shafique and fellow opener Imam-ul-Haq, who made 35, but an alert stumping from wicketkeeper Niroshan Dickwella broke the stand. The left-handed Imam missed a delivery from off-spinner Ramesh Mendis and Dickwella clipped off the bails, with the decision going up to the third umpire. After different TV angles it was established that Imam's foot was just millimetres off the ground when the bails were dislodged. Azhar Ali was the next to go when he edged a ball from Jayasuriya to first slip. He made six off 32 deliveries. Azam, who hit a defiant 119 in Pakistan's first-innings total of 218, then joined Shafique as the two rebuilt the innings on a turning pitch. Azam reached his fifty and two balls later Shafique got his second Test hundred with a single off Maheesh Theekshana, raising his bat to a standing ovation from the dressing room. Azam, who crossed 10,000 international runs on day two and averages over 45, went past 3,000 Test runs during another stubborn knock. Jayasuriya, who claimed a five-wicket haul in the previous innings, kept up the pressure with his turners and sliders. Sri Lanka took the second new ball in the 81st over but the spinners kept up the attack in the final few tense overs of the day. In the morning, Sri Lanka resumed the day on 329-9 in their second innings. Dinesh Chandimal was stranded on 94 when they were all out for 337."

The Games will now be held in Hangzhou from September 23 to October 8 2023, the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) said. The event was originally scheduled to be held in September this year, but organisers in May postponed it as China tried to stamp out a large Covid resurgence in several parts of the country. Hangzhou lies less than 200 kilometres (120 miles) from the country's biggest city Shanghai, which endured a months-long lockdown earlier this year as part of the ruling Communist Party's zero-tolerance approach to the virus. The OCA said on Tuesday that the new dates were chosen to avoid ""conflict with other major international sporting events"". The Asian Games typically attract over 10,000 athletes from across the region. China is the last major economy committed to stamping out domestic spread of the virus through harsh lockdowns, mass testing and strict controls on international travel. But that has hurt the country's international sporting ambitions, with the world's most populous nation cancelling or postponing almost all events since the start of the pandemic, with the exception of this year's Winter Olympics in Beijing. The World University Games, scheduled to begin in June in Chengdu and already delayed from last year, have also been postponed again, until 2023."

Hussain wants the governing International Cricket Council (ICC) to look at the ""absolutely crazy"" calendar and make changes to ease the strain on multi-format players like Stokes.

While the late, great Shane Warne undoubtedly produced the 'Ball of the Century' during the 20th century, Pakistan veteran Yasir Shah has laid claims to doing similar in the 21st century following his peach of a delivery against Sri Lanka in the first Test in Galle on Monday. Yasir delivered his own moment of magic when he clean bowled Sri Lanka batter Kusal Mendis with a textbook leg-spin delivery that completely bamboozled the in-form right hander. Similar to the efforts of Warne in Manchester some 29 years ago, Yasir's delivery pitched outside leg stump before turning sharply to the left and clipping the top of Mendis' off-stump. It immediately brought back memories of Warne's magical delivery to dismiss England veteran Mike Gatting during the first Ashes Test at Old Trafford in 1993, with commentators making an instant comparison between the two deliveries. While it will be difficult to surpass Warne's stunning ball, Yasir certainly went close as he produced a delivery that is sure to be talked about over the coming years. Let us know what you think of Yasir's delivery via the ICC social media channels and how it rates in comparison to Warne's 'Ball of the Century'.

Phillips was unbeaten in his 52-ball innings as he smashed seven boundaries in New Zealand's total of 173 for eight. Jimmy Neesham kept the runs flowing for New Zealand with a rapid 29 which included a towering six into the sightscreen. Ferguson turned the screw on Ireland in their chase with impressive figures of 4-14 as the hosts were bowled out for 142 in 18.2 overs. Ireland, who just missed out on a first ever victory over New Zealand when they lost the final ODI by one run last week, elected to field first in Dublin. It had looked a solid call when New Zealand opener Finn Allen fell for one in the third over off Joshua Little, who finished with four wickets. Martin Guptill (24) soon followed after he holed out at long off and Dane Cleaver (five) lasted only seven deliveries on his debut, nicking a length ball from Little behind. Daryl Mitchell was also dismissed for five off Curtis Campher to leave the tourists struggling at 54 for four in the ninth over. Phillips nipped Ireland's threat in the bud with his flamboyant stroke-play and New Zealand got an early breakthrough in the field when Mitchell Santner claimed a fine catch to dismiss Andy Balbirnie for 12.

Tuesday's match against South Africa at his home ground in Durham will be Stokes's 105th and final one-day international, the 31-year-old said in a statement issued by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). ""Three formats are just unsustainable for me now,"" said Stokes, who will continue to play Twenty20 Internationals. ""Not only do I feel that my body is letting me down because of the schedule and what is expected of us, but I also feel that I am taking the place of another player who can give (captain) Jos (Buttler) and the rest of the team their all."" Stokes, who took over as the test captain in April, was player-of-the-match when England beat New Zealand in the final to win their maiden 50-overs World Cup at Lord's in 2019. One of the most exciting players of his era, Stokes has battled a spate of injuries in recent times and took a break from the game last year to focus on his mental well-being. Stokes his made ODI debut against Ireland in Dublin in 2011. He has played 104 one-day internationals scoring 2919 runs, including three hundreds, at an average of 39.44 with a 95-plus strike rate.

3073556,Packed schedule a double-edged sword,19-07-2022,/sports/cricket/news/packed-schedule-double-edged-sword-3073556,sports,"Bangladesh concluded their Caribbean tour on a high after defeats in the Test and T20I series with a 3-0 whitewash in the ODIs, but the team will have little time to catch their breath as they are scheduled to head to Zimbabwe towards the end of the month. That busy schedule is something the Tigers will have to get used to in light of the news that Bangladesh have 34 Tests, 59 ODIs and 51 T20Is lined up for the 2024-2027 cycle under the proposed scheduled of the ICC Future Tour Programme (FTP). Bangladesh are only behind England (42), Australia (41) and India (38) in terms of the number of Tests that each nation will play in the proposed cycle, reported by ESPNCricinfo. Bangladesh also have the highest number of ODI assignments and their total number of matches stands at 144, only behind the West Indies, who will play 146 matches. Bangladesh have 34 Tests, 59 ODIs and 51 T20Is lined up for the 2024-2027 cycle under the proposed scheduled of the ICC Future Tour Programme (FTP). Bangladesh have 34 Tests, 59 ODIs and 51 T20Is lined up for the 2024-2027 cycle under the proposed scheduled of the ICC Future Tour Programme (FTP). Since Bangladesh received Test status, their performances in the longest format of the game has remained an area that they have looked to desperately improve. Discussions about how that could be achieved always noted that playing more Tests was a pre-requisite and, to some extent, the BCB's diplomatic success at the ICC table in this regard is praiseworthy. ""We have been trying to increase the number of games in our international calendar for the past eight years or so,"" BCB CEO Nizamuddin Chowdhury told The Daily Star yesterday. But, similar to the previous FTP cycle, none of Bangladesh's 34 Tests in the proposed FTP feature matches against England or Australia. After playing bilateral series against all Test-playing nations in the 2001-2006 FTP cycle, Australia did not play a Test series against the Tigers during the 2006-2011 cycle. Bangladesh did then host Australia and England in 2016 and 2017, but have had no Test series against the teams since. So questions remain how Bangladesh can improve the standard of Test cricket without facing top opponents in tougher conditions like Australia and England. On the flip side, the increase number of matches will pose a big challenge to the BCB's aims of lifting the standards of domestic cricket. Given such a busy international schedule, top cricketers' participation is likely to be an issue that makes domestic competitions less competitive. ""We are not doing well in Tests and T20Is. We already have a few plans for Test cricket. But the thing is that we have not able to understand what to do to make domestic cricket more competitive. The pitches are better now so I don't think we need to make any massive changes from that aspect. ""If we need the participation of national players to make domestic cricket more competitive but we are unable to ensure that, then how can we make the domestic cricket competitive? It's tough, but we have discussed the issue. Let's see,"" BCB president Nazmul Hassan told the media on Sunday."

The 28-year-old Nawaz, who played just three Tests for Pakistan in 2016, impressed with his left-arm spin to dent the Sri Lankan top and middle-order in the first match in Galle. He combined with leg-spinner Yasir Shah to reduce Sri Lanka to 267 for eight but the hosts hit back with Dinesh Chandimal's unbeaten 86 to lead by 333 at the end of the third day's play.

""I am very happy and I will keep working hard and repeat this kind of performance again."" Nawaz made his debut across formats in 2016 but his five-day career came to a halt after just three Tests against West Indies in the United Arab Emirates. His white-ball reputation has grown, with 19 one-day internationals and 30 Twenty20 matches for the national team, but he insists red-ball cricket is what excites him most. ""I kept on playing first-class cricket, obviously played a lot of white-ball international cricket but a Test opportunity didn't come my way,"" Nawaz said of his cricketing journey. ""Focus was to play red-ball cricket which makes you grow as a player. My 2022 red-ball season at home was good as I made over 700 runs and took 28-29 wickets. ""I'm happy to bowl well on my comeback and hoping to turn up with the bat as well."" Babar Azam's Pakistan will need to bowl out Sri Lanka, who were 329-9 at stumps, on the fourth day and then chase an already challenging-looking total. But Nawaz remains confident of the Pakistan batting that fought back from 87-5 to just four runs short of Sri Lanka's 222 in the first innings. ""They have put up a good total, looking at the conditions, but it's not impossible,"" he said. ""As a batting unit if we get two-three good partnerships then it will be achievable I think."""

With Kings needing only three points from remaining three matches to ensure the hattrick title of the professional football league, a feat shared by Abahani, the two-time champions had to suffer a setback from the start as on-song Brazilian forward Robson Da Silva was sidelined due to the muscle injury before fit-again Iranian defender Khalid Shafiei came into the pitch in the second half in place of forward Towhidul Alam Sabuj. Before the match began, most of the players from both sides appeared in a friendly mood in the tunnel but personal relations turned sour once the referee blew the whistle at kick-off. The match was full of intensity from the word go as every time there was a foul, the players of both teams invariably converged and were seen to push and shove on occasions. The aggressive approach of both sides saw Bashundhara King's left-back Yeasin Arafat get the marching order following two bookable offences and some Saif players were also booked. Hosts Saif, who lost their first-leg match 3-4 to Kings, were spirited and got off to a fine start and launched the first attack but Kings goalkeeper Anisur Rahman Zico frustrated Miraj Hossain and Mfon Sunday Udoh in the 18th minute. Visiting Kings then gradually established their control in the match to create three good chances, in which one attempt from Brazilian Miguel Ferrira came off the crossbar and one was capitalised by Matin Mia. In the 23rd minute, Miguel diagonally ran down from the right flank before letting loose a powerful left-footer on the top of the box but rattled the crossbar. Five minutes later, Spanish forward Noha Morang being fed by Miguel was denied by Saif goalkeeper Pappu Hossain but Matin, assisted by Miguel, drove home inside the box in the 28th minute. With Oscar Bruzon's side in the diving seat, left-back Yeasin Arafat picked up a second yellow card after fouling Rahim Uddin, forcing Kings into the back seat with 10 men in the 37th minute. After resumption, Oscar Bruzon strengthened his backline sending central-back Khalid in place of forward Sabuz and the Iranian defender made some good defending to frustrate the Saif forwards while goalkeeper Zico also denied Miraj twice before substitute Biplu Ahmed sealed off the match striking from outside the box, leaving the two Saif defenders ball-watching. Despite trailing by two goals, Saif's went all out to reduce the margin but Zico once again denied Sunday from a free kick while Noha made a goal-line save in the dying minutes to leave the ground on a high."

""I felt like I didn't do much wrong today, but I didn't do much right either,"" summed up McIlroy. ""It's just one of those days where I played a really controlled round of golf. ""I did what I felt like I needed to. At the end of the day, it's not life or death. ""It's one that I feel like I let slip away, but there will be other opportunities."" LOW SCORES As McIlroy and Hovland set out under overcast skies they no doubt noticed the low scores put up by early starters like Sadom Kaewkanjana of Thailand and Mexico's Abraham Ancer who were in the clubhouse with seven-under 65s. For Smith and Young the message was received -- the Claret Jug was still within reach. The world number two had preached patience the entire week and was doing just that as he reached the turn without a bogey, a single birdie good enough to keep him two shots ahead of a trio of challengers -- Hovland, Smith and Young. Yet while McIlroy was practising patience, Smith was mounting a devastating all-out attack, firing five straight birdies to start the back nine, knocking McIlroy from the top of the leaderboard. ""I sometimes think that being behind on certain golf courses and in certain situations is maybe a good thing,"" said Smith. ""I think it's very easy to get defensive out there and keep hitting it to 60, 70 feet, and you can make pars all day, but you're not going to make birdies. ""I think it was a good thing that I was definitely behind. ""I think my mindset would have been a touch different coming in, especially on that back nine, if I was ahead."" One more birdie at the 18th and all that was left for Smith to do was to wait and see if McIlroy, playing the pair behind him, could eagle the last to force a playoff. Smith was not celebrating just yet, knowing anything was possible having watched Young roll in a 15-foot eagle putt at the 18th to join him momentarily on 19-under, until he drained his short birdie to clinch the Jug. The 28-year-old earned $2.5 million for his win but that could be only a small fraction of the fortune awaiting him if media reports are true that he is about to sign on with the big-money Saudi-backed LIV Golf Invitational Series. LIV Golf has poached several top golfers away from the PGA Tour, luring them to the rebel circuit with multi-million dollar guaranteed contracts. Smith batted away questions about joining them saying he leaves that business to his team. ""I don't know, mate. My team around me worries about all that stuff,"" said Smith. ""I'm here to win golf tournaments."""

A 50-member Bangladesh contingent is set to take part in the 22nd edition multi-disciplinary extravaganza, scheduled to be held from July 28 to August 8 in England. The Bangladesh contingent will depart in phases for Birmingham from July 20 to take part in seven disciplines -- athletics, boxing, gymnastics, swimming, weightlifting, wrestling and table tennis -- but the organisers are not expecting much regarding medals. ""The chances of winning medals in Birmingham reduced a bit due to the exclusion of shooting and archery, but we are hopeful that the athletes will deliver their best in the world stage and bring laurels for the nation,"" Bangladesh Olympic Association's secretary general Syed Shahed Reza told reporters at an official press conference at BOA auditorium on Sunday. During the last Games held in Gold Coast, Australia in 2018, Shooter Abdullah Hel Baki and Shakil Ahmed won a silver medal each in their respective events while the rest of the athletes returned home empty handed. ""We have a good possibility to produce better results than the last edition because we have a good sprinter [England-based sprinter Imranur Rahman] who has been doing well. The table tennis team has also produced good results at international level in recent past while boxers are also performing well. We are expecting something better in other individual events as gymnast Ali Kader is expected to reach the final eight in his events,"" said BOA vice-president and Bangladesh Gymnastics Federation's president Bashir Ahmed Mamun. Replying to a query, Shahed Reza said, ""50 years into the independence, we don't have any intention to send athletes into Games as token participation, instead we want results. But we lack long-term training and financial ability. I am not disappointed, though, since we have improved in the past eight to 10 years as two of our athletes have qualified for the Olympics directly."" After the Commonwealth Games, a mega 84-member Bangladesh contingent will take part in the 5th Islamic Solidarity Games, to be held in Turkey from August 9 to 18. Bangladesh will participate in 11 disciplines -- athletics, archery, fencing, gymnastics, handball, karate, shooting, swimming, table tennis, weightlifting and wrestling -- with the expectation of good results from archery, athletics and gymnastics. Bangladesh won one gold, one silver and one bronze medal in the last edition of Islamic Solidarity Games in Baku, Azerbaijan in 2017. Shooters Baki and Syeda Atkia Hasan won gold in 10m air rifle mixed event while shooter Rabbi Hasan Munna and wrestler Shirin Sultana won silver and bronze medal in their respective events."
3072401,French hopes flagging on Tour de 'Lose',17-07-2022,/sports/cycling/news/french-hopes-flagging-tour-de-lose-3072401,sports,"Regional newspaper Le Progres groaned over the long wait for a home Tour de France stage winner this weekend with the scathing headline ""Blue, Blanc, Lose"", a play on the French tri-colour using lose instead of Rouge. The issue has become both a hot topic and a hot potato on an enthralling Tour featuring fans galore, eye-catching panoramas and an epic title struggle after Jonas Vingegaard knocked champion Tadej Pogacar off his perch in an Alpine stage for the ages. Danes and Belgians have won three stages in this pulsating 109th edition of the world's most prestigious bike race, the Dutch, Slovenians and Australians twice -- but France is still sighing with disappointment. Britain's Tom Pidcock and Bob Jungels of Luxembourg won the other stages, but at least the latter races for a French team -- AG2R. The charismatic climber Thibaut Pinot of the FDJ outfit has come closest for France, with a long-range bid Saturday giving him a third place for the second time. ""I'm so disappointed,"" said Pinot, reflecting the general mood of French cycling. ""It takes a little bit of luck, a little bit of legs, a little bit of everything,"" he said. A man who seems to make his own luck, Julian Alaphilippe was described as ""the Darling of France"" as he dashed around in the overall leader's yellow jersey for most of the 2018 Tour. France's double world champion Alaphilippe won a stage on each of the last four Tours, but hit a tree at high speed in the build-up to this one. His swashbuckling win on stage 1 last year is France's last, meaning that if no French rider wins Sunday's run to Carcassonne on stage 15, the wait stretches to 36 stages and counting. Pyrenees provides perfect platform But France may not have to wait too long, with a trilogy of Pyrenean Mountain stages coming up next week and a trident of domestic hopes capable of delivering what French fans often love best, a sudden burst of Gallic flair delivering triumph in the face of adversity. Pinot himself has previously achieved this, sending his emotional team boss Marc Madiot into delirium on the Col du Tourmalet in 2019. ""I'm looking forwards to the Pyrenees, those long climbs are the kind that suit me,"" he said, and his recent win on the Tour de Suisse suggests this is more than bluster. Pinot's younger teammate David Gaudu is also talking up a fight after finding his form on Saturday's final climb accompanied by blockbuster crowds. ""I unleashed the horses and boy did they run. Now I'm in the mood for it and I can't wait to get to the Pyrenees,"" he said. Gaudu is eighth in the overall leaderboard, just 4min 24sec off the lead. Ahead of him is Romain Bardet in fourth breathing down Ineos leader Geraint Thomas's neck. ""Romain seems to be on the form of his life,"" Thomas warned this week warning that Vingegaard and Pogacar have a series of challengers. Bardet himself was more gloomy on the issue. ""It'll have to be an ambush, Vingegaard and Pogacar are superior to the rest of us, there are four of us all fighting for third place,"" he said. Bardet suggested he would sacrifice a potential place on the podium in Paris for a stage win. ""If I get even a glimpse of an opportunity I'll go for it even if it's risky, a stage win remains my top priority,"" said Bardet. France would certainly thank him for it."

Hewitt won the 2001 US Open and 2002 Wimbledon titles among 30 career ATP triumphs and helped Australia capture the Davis Cup in 1999 and 2003. The 41-year-old from Adelaide was unable to travel to the Hall of Fame last year from Australia so his induction was postponed for a year and staged after Saturday's ATP Hall of Fame Open semi-finals. ""I think I needed that extra year to come up with some proper words,"" Hewitt said. ""This is an incredible honor for me. It has made it all the more special to be able to have my family and friends here."" The ceremony was staged on the court where Hewitt won his first ATP grass court match as a teen in 1998. Hewitt was a year-end world number one in 2001 and 2002 and his intense emotion combined with speed and skilled shotmaking made him a threat on any surface, great shots usually followed by the scream, ""Come on."" Hewitt finished with a career record of 616-262 in ATP singles play. The Aussie icon won his first ATP title in Adelaide in 1998 and his last in 2014 at the Hall of Fame Open, defeating Ivo Karlovic. ""I feel fortunate I was able to play across generations,"" Hewitt said, ""to play against my heroes like Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras"" as well as against legends Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic."

Kerley, in lane four, was down on Marvin Bracy for 95 metres of the tight race, but managed to outdip his teammate for victory in 9.86 seconds at Eugene's Hayward Field. Bracy took silver in 9.88sec, Trayvon Bromell claiming bronze in the same time for a third-ever 100m world championship cleansweep for the United States after 1983 and 1991. The fourth of the strong US quartet, Christian Coleman, the reigning world champion from Doha in 2019 who was banned from the Tokyo Olympics for missing three doping tests, finished sixth (10.01) despite an electric start. ""We said we were going to do it and we did! USA, baby!"" Olympic silver medallist Kerley said to roars of approval and applause from a partisan home crowd. It was far from plain sailing for the in-form Kerley, who set out his stall with a heat-winning 9.79sec on Friday, as all the sprinters got off to a good start. Bracy and Coleman looked like they might deprive Kerley of a gold many had predicted he would win. But they hadn't counted on his savage finishing skills, the former 400m runner showing all his strength at the line. Bromell also left it late to sneak onto the podium from lane eight. As the crowd realised it was a US cleansweep, chants of ""U-S-A"" rang out and flags brandished. Jamaica's Oblique Seville finished fourth in 9.97sec, just ahead of South African Akani Simbine, who was clocked at 10.01 like Coleman in sixth. Japan's Abdul Hakim Sani Brown and Canada's Aaron Brown were seventh and eighth, in 10.06 and 10.07sec respectively. Failing to advance from the semi-finals to the final were Canada's Olympic 200m champion Andre de Grasse, also a two-time 100m bronze medallist, and 2011 world champion Yohan Blake of Jamaica. The build-up to the final was rocked by the decision of Olympic champion Marcell Jacobs to withdraw just hours before the semi-finals with a tightness in his right thigh. Italian team doctor Andrea Billi said that evaluation of the contraction had found a ""clinical picture that can put muscle integrity at risk and lead to injury"". Jacobs, who pulled off one of the shocks of the Tokyo Olympics last year after storming to victory in the 100m in a time of 9.80sec, was crowned world indoor 60m champion in Belgrade in March but has struggled with injury since. ""I am a fighter and this is why I decided to be in Eugene,"" he tweeted, saying it had been a ""painful choice, I am forced to stop""."

Was it the perfect swansong for Felix? Not quite, as she and Kennedy Simon were both reeled in on their resepctive legs, leaving the Dominican Republic to take victory in the 4x400m mixed relay, the Dutch quartet edging the US for silver. Her bronze is Felix's 19th at world champs in a career that started almost two decades ago and also included 11 Olympic medals. ""It was very special to be able to run in front of a home crowd for my last race,"" said Felix. ""It was so cool. My daughter was in the stands. It was a night I will cherish."" Felix added: ""I've had such good memories. I know it is time and these guys will carry it on into the future. ""I am at peace stepping into this next stage and have tremendous gratitude for this sport."" Two-time Olympic shot put champion Ryan Crouser had high praise for his US team co-captain. ""She's done so much for the sport and especially for women athletes, attracting attention to some really important issues we have in the sport,"" Crouser said of Felix. ""She's a fantastic athlete, but also a fantastic person. She does stuff the right way, she is just a class act, and kind of the definition of integrity."" In-form Kerley ran a sensational heat-winning 9.79 seconds in a warning to potential rivals for the 100m crown. He advanced to Saturday's semi-finals along with teammates Marvin Bracey, Trayvon Bromell and defending champion Christian Coleman, who missed the Tokyo Olympics after missing three doping tests. ""It's going to take something fast to win,"" predicted Canada's reigning Olympic 200m champion Andre de Grasse, also twice a 100m bronze medallist. Reigning Olympic champion Marcell Jacobs, a shock winner in Tokyo who has struggled with injury this season, acknowledged that he had struggled in his heat. ""I am not at my 100%,"" the Italian said. ""Running 10.04 at half capacity of what I can run, I can say my physical shape is fine. I just need to get my legs ready."" - History for Peru - There was a historic first ever world medal for Peru as Kimberly Garcia Leon won the women's 20km race walk, the first medal event at the Eugene worlds. ""This is the first medal for us at the world championships and I hope it won't be the last one,"" said the Peruvian, also entered into the 35km race walk. The second medal event of the champs saw Toshikazu Yamanishi produce a brutal final kick to defend his world men's 20km race walk title. In a Japanese 1-2, compatriot Koki Ikeda took silver, seven seconds off the winning pace, in a repeat of the result at March's World Race Walking Team Championships in Muscat. Home hopes of gold in the men's shot put were kept alive as world record holder Crouser qualified for Sunday's final with a 22.28m effort. Dutch distance sensation Sifan Hassan is defending champion in the women's 1500m, but she has opted out of defending her title in Eugene. She will instead concentrate on the 5,000-10,000m double, which she pulled off at last year's Tokyo Olympics. Hassan also won bronze in the 1500m in the Japanese capital, a race won by Kenya's Faith Kipyegon ahead of Briton Laura Muir. Both Kipyegon and Muir qualified smoothly for Saturday's semi-final, with the final scheduled for Monday."

The 82-year-old singer voiced scores of memorable Bollywood numbers. ""He was suffering from several health complications, including urinary issues since some time,"" his wife Mitali Singh (formerly known as Mitali Mukherjee) told Indian media. Born on February 6, 1940 in Amritsar, Bhupinder performed on Delhi's All India Radio at the beginning of his career, while also being associated with its famed Doordarshan Center. He was also proficient in guitar and violin. In 1962, music director Madan Mohan gave him his first break and called him to Bombay. He gave his voice to the song ""Hoke Majboor Mujhe Usne Bulaya Hoga"" with Mohammed Rafi, Talat Mahmood and Manna Dey in Chetan Anand's ""Haqeeqat"". He was given his solo break in the film ""Aakhri Khat"". The artiste is remembered for his unforgettable voice in ""Mausam"", ""Satte Pe Satta"", ""Ahista Ahista"", ""Dooriyan"" and ""Haqeeqat"" amongst many others. A few among his many hits are ""Dil Dhoondta Hai"", ""Naam Gum Jaayega"", ""Ek Akela Is Shaher Mein"", ""Beeti Na Beetai Raina"", ""Huzoor Is Kadar bhi na Itra ke Chaliye"", ""Kisi Nazar Ko Tera Intezar Aaj Bhi Hai"" and ""Baadalon Se Kaat Kaat Ke"". He also sang beautiful Bengali tracks, including ""Kobe Je Kothay"", ""Keu Bhul Kore"", ""O Amar Monjusa"" and ""Tomay Cheye Ar Na Chawa"". He was known for his deep, bass-like voice and unmatchable work ethic. As a guitarist, he lent his talent to classics like ""Dum Maro Dum"", ""Chura Liya Hain"", ""Chalte Chalte"", ""Mehbooba o Mehbooba"" and ""Chingari Koi Bhadke"". In the mid-1980s, Bhupinder married the Bangladeshi singer Mitali Mukherjee, as his appearances in films became sporadic. He is also survived by his son Nihal Singh, who is also a talented musician."
3074356,J-Hope dives into darkness with ‘Jack in the Box’,19-07-2022,/entertainment/music/news/j-hope-dives-darkness-jack-the-box-3074356,entertainment,"J-Hope of BTS fame made his debut as a solo artist with his latest album ""Jack in the Box"". On the album, J-Hope showcased that he was not afraid to embrace the reality of the world, and that he was ready to work his through any broken path or challenge to reach his goals. The 22-minute long album starts with an introduction track titled ""Intro"", that tells the tale of Pandora's Box. The female narrator for ""Intro"" says, ""It was Hope that was kept in the innermost nook of the box. It trailed behind the miasma of darkness, assuaging the ill effects on humankind. Hope gave people the will to keep on living amidst the pain and strife."" While J-Hope's 2018 mixtape ""Hope World"", was full of colours and shared the artist's gratitude for his life and work, ""Jack in the Box"" is full of darkness. This contrast of light and dark is prevalent throughout the album, with the artist hinting that 'hope' is the only thing helps us survive the darkness of life. Using the sounds of hip-hop, rap-rock, R&B, and grunge, J-Hope was able to shock fans with a new and unique sound that they previously did not associate with the artist. While listening to the first single of this album ""More"", I was stunned because I had never expected to see this version of J-Hope in my dreams, let alone in reality. This album is almost like a storybook, which one needs to approach chronologically, with all 10 tracks acting like 10 chapters of a novel. ""Stop"", followed by ""More"", gave us an idea of the ideals with which J-Hope lives his life, particularly the idea that there are no 'bad people' in this world. The artist questions if people are truly black and white, which to him does not make sense. Instead, he feels that people are almost like the different shades of grey, where it is impossible to just label them as just good or bad. Eventually, J-Hope asks listeners to stop the judgement and calm down. ""= (Equal Sign)"" is another song with a message, that asks to put a stop to the endless discrimination that we engage in and face ourselves in this world. J-Hope tries to send the message that everyone, irrespective of age, gender, and borders, are equal. By the end of the song, the artist urges people to not fill their hearts and minds with hate, as this will only paralyse them; leaving us with the message that it costs nothing to be kind. The first half of the album tells us the story of Jack, which in this case is J-Hope himself, who is living inside a box, hoping to eventually get out. After the interlude, ""Music Box: Reflection"", it is presumed that Jack has finally escaped from his box, and now is finally able to see that life no longer looks the same as it did from inside. From questioning what would he would be without the success and fame he has now, to thinking about the future, J-Hope bares it all on ""Jack in the Box"". The album ends with the song ""Arson"", saying, ""Do I put out the fire, or burn even brighter?"""

The Raihan Rafi directorial film has been performing well in theatres, with the audience appreciating Mim's acting in the movie. Recently, Bidya Sinha Mim penned a heartfelt status about the director of ""Poran"", Raihan Rafi. ""I consider Raihan Rafi to be a magician. I didn't know him that well before working together on 'Poran'. While I had watched some of his films, I didn't know him personally. I never saw him projecting himself as a 'big director'. He always seemed to be in a fun mood on set,"" said Mim. ""Among all the directors that I have worked with till now, I think after the great Humayun Ahmed, Raihan Rafi carries the image of a celebrity filmmaker. People want to take pictures with him, everybody knows him as Rafi bhai. He earned this popularity through his hard work and I think of it as a big deal. Apart from the popularity of heroes and heroines, it is wonderful to see a director being given such star power in this industry,"" mentioned the actress. ""There were sequences in 'Poran', where the audience fell in love with Ananya's playful personality. Raihan Rafi helped me with those scenes by acting them out for me. I don't think I would have been able to do justice to Ananya's character without the help of Rafi bhai. He also helped Yash and Razz with their respective roles as well. Raihan Rafi really knows how to guide an artiste through the journey of their characters,"" added Mim. ""According to me, Rafi bhai's greatest quality is that he knows how to tell a story through a variety of angles. I have worked with him on two other movies, 'Damaal' and 'Ittefaq'. The shooting of 'Damaal' has been completed, while we are halfway through shooting for 'Ittefaq',"" said the actress. The actress concluded her post by saying that working with Raihan Rafi was a 'turning point' in her career, and how the director was now a lucky charm for her."

Having worked together in projects like ""Chandrakotha"" and ""Amar Ache Jol"", popular actor Ferdous walks down the memory lane, recalling his fond memories of the legendary writer. I was a college student when I first met Humayun Ahmed at the Ekushey Boi Mela. He was giving out autographs at a stall. By that time, I had already read ""Shankhanil Karagar"" and ""Nandito Noroke"" and was a huge fan of his. Without further delay, I took a place in the long waiting lines at the stall. After buying one of his books, he signed it with the message, ""Shubheccha"" (Best Wishes). Having waited for a long time in the line, I could not digest the fact that he just wrote one word for me. I bought another book by him and stood back into the line. When I reached him, he recognized me and asked, ""Didn't I just sign your book?"" ""You just wrote a word for me and it hurt me, so I came back,"" I replied. This time he wrote, ""Bhalobeshe Jaare Chhui Shei Jai Dhirgho Porobashe"" (Everyone I love decides to leave). This time, I was more than happy. What a beautiful line! After college, I started pursuing higher academic at Dhaka University and also decided to venture out into modelling. I decided to visit BFDC, unaware of the fact that I would be meeting my favourite writer for the second time. Upon arriving, Amir Hossain Babu introduced me to him. Without delay, I shared my dream of becoming an actor with him. He asked if I would be able to concentrate on my studies if I set into this line of work. I told him that I am confident that I will be able to pull it off. ""Confidence is essential, never let it leave you,"" he said. Long after this meeting, I received a call for him after my first film, ""Hotath Brishti"" was released. He blessed me and appreciated my effort. I have taken up only two tele-productions in my life. ""Esho"", one of the two, was directed by Humayun Ahmed. After ""Hotath Brishty"", Humayun sir had requested me to take up this project of his. With time, our bond deepened, as I got the opportunity to work in his films. We shared a unique friendship – he would be a father to me sometimes, sometimes an elder brother, often a well wisher and most of the time, a very special friend. I remember how, during one of the ""Mahurat"" of his film at Nuhash Palli, he asked us to step in the water and asserted that the event will be held in the pond. Sunil Gangapadhaya, Matiur Rahman, and many others were present that day. Without delay, I hopped into the pond. That is how Humayun Ahmed was – a little crazy, childish at times, but knew how to enjoy little things in life. He was very interested in the moon and stars. Once during shoot – he took us all to enjoy the full moon after dinner. I still remember the stories we all shared all night long under the beaming moonlight.

They both made some great and beautiful memories together, which the artiste still cherishes. On the occasion of the tenth death anniversary of the magician of words, Jewel shared his favourite book of Humayun Ahmed, in a recent interview with The Daily Star. ""When it comes to his writings, it's tough to talk about one specific book that I loved. I think I would choose the book ""Jochona O Jononir Golpo"" -- it was based on our Liberation War. I don't think any Bengali writer had ever written any book on 1971 in such a broad scale, touching the hearts of readers and made them cry. This is my favourite book of his. One of the best things about his writings was, he always wrote in such a way that everybody can understand, and can relate to. This is the important thing to attract the readers. I could even laugh in pain, whenever I read his books. Not many people have his ability – he had that power over people. I also loved his book ""Badshah Namdar"". I can't explain in words how much I loved this book. All the events of the Mughal dynasty came alive in front of my eyes, when I read the book. Perhaps that's why he was called the ""magician of words"", because he made the stories alive through his writing. There was no way you can leave without finishing his books at one go. I couldn't even concentrate on other works, if I left without finishing his books. That's how his books have touched my heart and the millions of his readers. He created two immortal characters, Himu and Misir Ali, which I loved very much. Himu was a unique character who had the quality to shock people with his interesting talks. The appeal of Humayun Ahmed's writing will never end because he has portrayed the life of the middle-class people with such grace in his writing that made him the magician of Bengali literature."""

You have a little niece, we have named her Harmony Geetolina. I can only imagine the joy on your face when you would have held her in your arms. I am sure you would have been the first one to arrive with your wife and kids to see her. By now, you would have been the proud father of two beautiful children. You would have mocked my maternal obesity and within just a few minutes, you would have said, ""No worries pal, you will regain your old shape in no time!"" You know, Harmony would have been born a cancer, just like you and I, if she had delayed her birth by just a day. She was born on June 20. Harmony Geetolina—such a nice name, right? Her name is inspired from Rabindranath Tagore's ""Geetabitan"". Explaining the meaning of 'Geetolina' would not have been necessary if you were here, as Tagore always had a special place in your heart. You are doing well, right? Walking along the waves, you decided to find your house in the mild beams of moonlight, leaving us behind. Are you well in your moon-house? Abid passed away on July 29, 2011 at the mere age of 26.

The month-long exhibition concludes tomorrow. The artist's singular style occupies time-honoured folk motifs and Bengali ballads. Throughout his entire life and artistic career, Samar Majumder persistently experiments with newer modes of expression - his compositions are natural in essence, as they relate to the soul, soil and the bucolic beauty of Bangladesh. He consciously takes his artistic muse and strength from human feelings and emotions. Art lovers can easily connect his simplistic forms that engage his ideas in a dialectical exploration of metaphors, nuances and meanings. Yet, at the same time, they depict different expressive modes. Folk art has got a new lease of life, thanks to the dedicated creative efforts by the artist. He continues to experiment with the conventional folk motifs and creates his own works blending those with the touch of modernity. Following the folk-traditions of Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin, Patua Quamrul Hassan, Safiuddin Ahmed, SM Sultan, Jamini Roy and other master artists, the prominent features in Samar's works include varied connotations of folk elements such as tepa putul, sora, nakshi kantha, design of homemade cake, jar, boat, bird, tree, river, fish, crop, flower, fruit, animal and the life sketches of rural people. Samar Majumder's compositions are bordered with free-flowing thick brush lines set on a thin layered colour background.  His sketches retain only the bare essentials, sometimes employing just a brief line to cover for a whole figure. Yet, they are immensely expressive. Mature hues and a lyrical colour balance are prominent features of his body of works. Closely observing the lives of village people, artisans, farmers and the nature of rural Bangladesh, the artist has adeptly depicted common characters of pastoral Bangladesh. The 'rakhal' playing flute, fishermen's fishing in the river at night, house in coastal area, mother, angling whole day on a boat, framers' working in the field, village girl with her pet, girl with water lily and the musician are some of his prominent depictions for the ongoing exhibit. His three-decade long career as an Assistant Chief Designer at BSCIC (Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation) helped him understand and support various artisans. At BSCIC, he also received mentorship from legendary artist Quamrul Hassan. He initially worked with textiles and tapestry, but his work allowed him to travel throughout the country where he got to know the lives of artisans and rural people. Samar Majumdar started painting in his early childhood. Later, he completed his academic studies from the Institute if Fine Arts, University of Dhaka in 1980. For the last four decades, he has been working on book cover designs and illustrations. He also garnered the best cover designer award from National Book Center six times."

The exhibition features multiple series of abstract, objective and non-objective paintings by the artist such as ""Horizon"", ""Memory"", ""Fragment"", ""My Journey"", ""Mindscape"", and ""Before Time"". Initially, the exhibition began on June 18 and is now set to be available at the gallery till July 23. ""Normally whenever we think about the horizon, we look as far as our vision can comprehend,"" said Azmeer Hossain. ""However, I cannot help but wonder what's beyond that. Every painting in this exhibition embodies the horizons of my mind, accumulating over my experience with nature, life, and my imagination."" Every painting in this exhibition expresses a unique sensation through the use of space and dimensions as if to give the viewers an insightful look towards the infinite horizon trapped in the canvas. ""Azmeer sir's work has always been fascinating as they represent so much more than what meets the eye,"" says Sanjida Sultana, a school teacher and passionate artist. ""His efforts and thoughts are apparent in his art. No wonder his paintings take months or even years to complete."" Taking a closer look, viewers may notice the vast multitude of layers used to perfectly portray the space between the subjects in the paintings in such a way so that it seamlessly mirrors reality. ""In our daily life we are living in a city that is filled with diversified textures, noises, forms, colours, sounds and smells,"" said renowned artist Syed Golam Dastagir. ""This chaotic and packed city is where Azmeer was born and brought up, and this has greatly influenced his art."" Watercolour has been a traditional medium in Bangladeshi art, dating from the Pala to Mughal eras. However, this particular type of watercolour was of an opaque quality. Later on, the British era introduced a new type of watercolour that belonged to the British impressionist school, which is transparent in nature. Azmeer Hossain is well known for his mastery over the use of watercolours. ""We are learning a lot about art every day. Yet, I feel the methods we use to create art should be equally researched,"" said the artist. After almost twenty-five years of studying and research, Azmeer Hossain came up with his own unique way of using watercolours. ""Suppose a buffalo stands before a tree. There is an obvious gap between the two subjects in reality, yet watercolour painting methods would not be able to express that gap in the canvas."" ""Over the years, I have developed my own way to remedy these flaws of watercolour,"" mentions Azmeer Hossain. ""This particular way of using watercolour has become my signature style."" ""In the future, I am hoping to spread my knowledge on watercolours to the next generation of artists,"" concluded Azmeer Hossain."

3063766,How Jnanadanandini Devi taught Bengali working women to wear the Sari ,4/7/2022,/entertainment/theatre-arts/news/how-jnanadanandini-devi-taught-bengali-working-women-wear-the-sari-3063766,entertainment,"At the helm of the Bengali Renaissance were the Tagores of Jorasanko, among whom was the bold and independent Jnanadanandini Devi, the bride of Satyendranath Tagore. She was a social reformer whose revolutionary style in sari made her an icon for working women. In the 19th century Bengal, women of the affluent class were seen wearing semi-transparent and light sarees without the use of undergarments. Jnanadanandini was married into the Tagore family which meant that she would be residing in the Tagore Zenana, the inner rooms of the residence reserved for female family members of the household. It was a common cultural product of the Indo-Islamic period and a system of seclusion for married women at the time. However, village women who lived outside of such seclusions had the freedom to wear woven saris, unlike the Zenana sari which was not intended for public wear. These affluent women could only drape winter shawls as an additional garment over their Zenana sharis. Her husband, Satyendranath Tagore, would bring his young wife across India to Bombay to get a taste of the multicultural life in the West. Socialising with European circles including Parsi and European women as well as entering a sphere of English customs became a vision of courage. While socialising with the Parsi and European ladies; a wave of courage and inspiration took over her spirit. She wanted to design a sari which will incorporate the essence of both Parsi and Bengali culture in one. It was a big challenge, but her husband was extremely supportive of her decision. 'If you have to change your mode of dress, please do not hesitate'' said Satyendranath Tagore. She improvised upon the traditional sari, blending her own style with that of Parsi women. She observed the styles of the English blouses, sleeves, ribbons, and brooches. These reiterations gave life to the modern day saree by draping the aanchall over the left shoulder, freeing the right arm. She created frontal pleats and brooches. A blouse and petticoat was also introduced after the influence of Parsi women. The style became to be known as the Thakurbari Sari, an epitome of the modern, educated, and privileged woman. Jnanadanandini went on to train other women to wear the saree in her own style through advertisements in the Bamabodhini Patrika. This introduced a generation of working-class women to show up in public wearing saris - to work, to parties, and to the global arena. Jnanadandini's boldness taught the world that these women could come out of confinement and enter global spheres, carrying the pride of their own history in their attire. It gave saris nationwide acceptability and to women, their mobility. It meant that women, even today, could keep with them an enduring proof of a lasting history of Indo-Western tradition which emerged from a silent but illustrious revolution by the women of the Tagore family. Even though this daring act caused much discord in the household, Jnanadanlini's courage and creativity paved the way to break the customs of the upper caste. These women must never be forgotten for their insurmountable significance in the Bengali Renaissance. Their role went beyond raising an intellectual awakening among the people - it revolutionized the lives of the contemporary in a materialistic way forever. Today, this style is the most popular way to drape a sari and its artistry is embraced by women in all parts of the world."

As per the month-to-month calculation, inflation stands at 7.56 per cent in June, which should be 5.9 per cent according to the government calculation, he said. He spoke in a virtual press conference after a meeting of the cabinet committee on public purchase today. ""There was over 12 per cent inflation when we came to the power and the forex reserve was $7 billion, which started rising and hit $48 billion. It has decreased in recent times, but still there is $40 billion."" Asked whether the government will take loan from the International Monetary Fund, the minister said: ""We didn't get any official proposal from the IMF in this regard yet and we didn't also send any proposal."" Bangladesh will not send any loan proposal to the IMF now. ""We will take loan when it is needed and you (journalists) will come to know about it then.""

World Trade Organisation (WTO) Director General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala termed it an unprecedented package of deliverables.   The outcome document emphasised the need for the proper functioning of the WTO, reaffirmed its fundamental principle and envisioned reforms to improve its functions. It may throw in to the resurrection of the multilateral trading system. However, the expectation of graduating least-developed countries (LDCs) remained almost unmet.    The second part contains nine declarations: agreement of fisheries subsidies; work programme on electronic commerce; Covid-19 pandemic and preparedness for future pandemics; TRIPS agreement; food purchases exemption from export prohibitions or restrictions; emergency response to food insecurity; Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Declaration; TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) non-violation and situations complains; and a work programme on small economies. Bangladesh needs to be committed to developing the capacities of the multilateral trading system. A specific task force can be framed for better preparation in future 


 Bangladesh needs to be committed to developing the capacities of the multilateral trading system. A specific task force can be framed for better preparation in future  Services waiver and improved data on LDC services export, services suppliers and consumers of LDC services in the markets of members that notified preferences were discussed. The General Council will report it to the next ministerial conference, the MC13.   A similar is the case for preferential rules of origin and the implementation of the Nairobi Ministerial decision. It instructed the Committee on Rules of Origin to report to the General Council ahead of the MC13. In regard to the implementation of the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), all members were called upon to assist LDCs to help them meet their definitive category commitments within deadlines. The trade facilitation committee will review it on an annual basis. Members acknowledged the environmental challenges and climate change implications and endorsed the importance of the contribution of the multilateral trading system to the UN 2030, and the Sustainable Development Goals.  LDCs need support for technological innovation and in that respect, the role of trade and environment as a standing forum is dedicated to dialogue among members to understand the relationships between trade measures and environmental measures. Fisheries subsidies, the most debated issues, agreed to prohibit granting subsidies to the vessels engaged in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, overfishing, and other subsidies relating to fishing outside the jurisdiction of a coastal member or a non-member and outside the competence of the Regional Fisheries Management Organisation/Arrangement. The agreement is specifically meant for marine wild capture fishing and fishing-related activities at the high sea and does not concern aquaculture and inland fishing. Developing countries have been granted two years after their entry into force. LDCs will get further extended time for notification obligations. About 30 per cent of the estimated annual global catch (109 million tonnes annually) remain unreported. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimated that 70 per cent of the fish population is fully used, overused or in crisis. Among all the countries, China catches the fish most. The FAO also mentioned that a third of the world's assessed fisheries have currently been pushed beyond their biological limits. Developing countries requested a 25-year transition. LDCs exemption can be continued for some years, meaning graduating time plus 25 years. Developed countries were extending subsidies for fishing, fuel, vessels and many other areas for long amounting to trillions of dollars.  However, the text does not create disciplines on certain forms of fisheries subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and over-fishing. In the regard to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, some agreement has been reached.  But the texts are rather unclear and the issue has been left for the MC13. However, Article 12 of the agreement has given a deadline of four years after its entry into force to agree on the above comprehensive discipline. Unless otherwise decided by the general council, the agreement shall stand immediately terminated. The decision on the TRIPS waiver to be used by the eligible developing countries to authorise the use of certain patented Covid-19-related products without the prior consent of the right holder and to address the Covid-19 pandemic. Covid-19 diagnostics and therapeutics are not eligible.  The waiver is agreed for five years, irrespective of whether a compulsory licence regime is in place. The authorising members may allow the resulting products to be exported to other developing countries eligible for the TRIPS waiver. The importing countries will prevent re-export unless exceptional humanitarian and not-for-profit purposes. The transparency mechanism is included to communicate any measures related to the implementation of the decision to the TRIPS Council.  Some developing countries like India with the capacity of producing vaccines will benefit. Bangladesh has better capacities in the pharmaceutical sector. However, substantial efforts have not been visible so far in producing vaccines. The decisions acknowledge for not imposing WTO-inconsistent export prohibitions or restrictions on agri-food trade and ensuring that any emergency measures to address food security will be ensured. For electronic commerce, the current practice of not imposing customs duties on electronic transmissions until MC13 will remain. However, if the MC13 is delayed beyond March 31, 2024, the moratorium will expire on that date unless the Ministers or the General Council take a decision to extend it.  The SPS committee will continue to undertake valuable work and members remain committed to the continued enhancement of the implementation of the SPS agreement. The SPS committee will report to the MC13 on the key findings and actions undertaken. The WTO has a big role to deal with the challenges of trade-related issues.  A number of countries have been pre-empting and establishing rules that are sometimes beyond WTO rules, such as e-commerce, leaving others with genuine development concerns. The outcome remains silent in this respect. The extension of LDC exemption even after graduation was the number one agenda for graduating LDCs. The United States outright rejected the issue while the director-general of the WTO seemed to be a bit patient in the town hall meeting. Bangladesh would need to handle these issues with utmost importance bilaterally before the next multilateral negotiation. This is not easy but possible. Dispute settlement issues for safeguarding the interest of a country, trade-related legal capacities to work as a practitioner, and professionalism in trade law have to be developed. Bangladesh needs to be committed to developing the capacities of the multilateral trading system. A specific task force can be framed for better preparation in future.

3074646,Use of concrete blocks in public construction still low,20-07-2022,/business/economy/news/use-concrete-blocks-public-construction-still-low-3074646,business,"The progress in using concrete blocks instead of bricks for all public development projects has been sluggish as government agencies have made little efforts in this regard due to lax monitoring by the relevant authorities, according to experts. In a notification issued on November 24, 2019, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change declared the use of bricks for construction would be gradually phased out by 2025 in order to curb environmental degradation. As such, concrete blocks will be used in all public construction projects, including herringbone bond roads and type-B village roads. The move came amid concerns of rising air pollution caused by expanding production at brick kilns to meet soaring demand from the construction sector. The kilns release carbon dioxide and other harmful substances during the production process, which involves baking clay. There are between 7,000 and 10,000 kilns across the country that produce 23 billion bricks annually, emitting about 15.67 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, according to industry trade bodies and the Department of Environment (DoE). In addition, the brick making industry requires the excavation of around 33.50 billion cubic feet of clay each year, causing dust pollution and sedimentation. As per the notification, concrete blocks would have to make up at least 10 per cent of the materials used by government agencies in their respective development projects in fiscal 2019-20 and 20 per cent the following year. The threshold then rose to 60 per cent for the current fiscal and 80 per cent for fiscal 2023-24 while the use of bricks would be completely phased out by fiscal 2024-25. The directive is not applicable for the construction and repairing of the base and sub-base of highways, it said. In addition, legal action will be taken in the case of any deviation from the mentioned time-frame of the workplan. But despite the ministry having outlined its annual target in this regard, government agencies have not shown much effort to follow the guideline. Asked about the progress of the implementation, Abdul Hamid, director general of the DoE, said they are working on it. ""There are no other comments for you,"" he told this correspondent at his office on Monday. Hamid further declined to comment on any potential legal action against those who violated the guidelines established in 2019 to level up the progress to this end. The Daily Star also contacted Sanjay Kumar Bhaumik, additional secretary (environment) at the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. Bhaumik also declined to make any comment, citing that he recently joined the post. Md Ziaul Haque, director of the DoE in Dhaka, admitted that for various reasons, including the coronavirus pandemic, their goals have not yet been achieved. ""Though a clear direction has been given to different government agencies, like the LGED and Public Works Department, the target has not been achieved,"" Haque said. ""We are trying our best to monitor in order to implement the order and also issued letters to the planning commission to not approve any infrastructure project that will not use a certain number of concrete blocks,"" he added. He too did not give any exact figure on the progress rate but said they have asked all the concerned government agencies to submit progress reports. Haque then assured that if this works effectively, the target will be achievable. On the other hand, Sakhawat Hossain, head of sales at Mir Concrete Products Ltd, said although the market for concrete blocks has expanded, they did not see any robust initiatives from government agencies to use them. Hossain went on to say that the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) and Public Works Department did show some initiative, albeit at a slow pace. Asked about the lack of monitoring from the DoE, he said the results speak for themselves as traditional clay bricks still dominate the construction sector. Developers and contractors are still prone to use clay bricks, though the cost is comparatively same with concrete blocks, Hossain added. Amirul Alam, assistant general manager for sales, marketing and operations at Hatim Concrete Industries Limited, echoed the same. ""If the government agencies would follow the instruction properly, then the block construction markets would expand vastly,"" he said. Mohammad Aktaruzzaman, head of marketing and sales at Concord, one of the leading concrete block makers in the country, said the government should focus on raising awareness to meet its target. Besides, the government should form a regulatory authority, such as the Bangladesh Standard Testing Institute, to monitor the overall progress in this regard. ""If there is no regulatory body, the expected output will not come. The market is growing by about 30 per cent annually and now there are around 200 concrete blocks makers in the country, which is a positive sign,"" he added. Md Nafizur Rahman, senior research architect and head of the housing division of the House Building Research Institute (HBRI), said both government and private initiatives need attain the block using targets by 2025. ""If we make people understand the harmful effects of the clay-burned bricks, they would become interested in using concrete blocks,"" Rahman added. Adil Mohammad Khan, general secretary of the Bangladesh Institute of Planners, also found the government supervision and monitoring to be wanting. ""Many autonomous and semi-government organisations do not feel the need to follow these guidelines, and there is a significant lack of adherence to these guidelines,"" he said. So, it should be mandatory for every government institution to report quantitative statistics on concrete block usage after implementation. ""Special incentives may be offered to the government-private initiatives to increase the block factories to surge the block supply as well,"" Khan added."
3074666,Dry spell rings alarm for Aman cultivation,20-07-2022,/business/economy/news/dry-spell-rings-alarm-aman-cultivation-3074666,business,"It's rainy reason in Bangladesh and agricultural land is supposed to be wet with monsoon rains by now.   But a vast part of land is currently dry and cracks have formed in many parts of the country, particularly in the north, affecting the cultivation of Aman rice, the second-largest paddy after Boro, amid dry spell. According to the Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD), the country recorded 86 per cent less rainfall until July 17, against 523 millimetres on average usually seen in the month, compelling growers to turn to diesel-run pumps to prepare lands and transplant seedlings to avoid late planting since it would reduce yields. ""We have been passing our days looking at the sky for rains,"" said Nurul Islam, a farmer of Hosennagar village under the sadar upazila of Rangpur, the main producer of Aman in the north, which accounts for 36 per cent of the total output of the rice variety. The grower had prepared his seedbed on two bighas of land to plant Aman. The seedlings have grown fully, but he could not prepare the land on time to transplant the seedlings for the drought-like situation. Finally, after waiting for seven days, he had to depend on water pumps to irrigate though this would increase his production cost. He and his farmers across the country rely on rainwater to produce the paddy variety. ""My expenses would go up by Tk 1,500 per bigha for operating the diesel pump,"" Islam said. The unfavourable weather following repeated floods had hurt the previous two rice crops -- Boro and Aush. This fanned concerns about the food security of the nation at a time when the war in Ukraine is disrupting the supply of grains. Rice is the staple food and Aman accounted for 39 per cent of the total annual production of the grains estimated at around 3.80 crore tonnes during the last fiscal year of 2021-22. The mild heat wave has created worries among farmers and agronomists as any delay in transplantation will reduce the overall yield from the crop. The government targets to bag 1.63 crore tonnes of rice to offset the losses of Boro and Aush crops. Until yesterday, farmers transplanted Aman on 1.57 lakh hectares of land, out of the government's target of 56.30 lakh hectares, according to the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE). Farmers have prepared seedlings on 2.57 lakh hectares so far. ""My seedlings matured a week ago and I have been watering them to keep them alive. I don't know when the rain will come and we will start transplantation. We are worried,"" said Md Khaja Mia, a farmer in Shibganj upazila of Bogura district. Abdul Halim, a farmer in Rajosh of Gobindaganj upazila of Gaibandha, says all water-bodies, crops lands, canals and ponds are dry now. ""We are witnessing this type of drought in our district for the first time since 2001. There has been no rain since June 17 in this area."" Farmers normally start transplanting Aman on the first day of Srabon (July 16) as per the Bangla calendar year. ""We will have to spend for irrigation if there is no rainfall,"" Halim said, adding that per unit cost of electricity is Tk 4.5 while diesel costs Tk 80 a litre. Habibur Rahman, a farmer of the Bherberi union of Khansama upazila of Dinajpur, usually completes Aman cultivation by July 20 every year. ""But, it seems that it would be late by a couple of weeks this year,"" he said. ""We are already 15-20 days behind the usual Aman cultivation period. We are worried because the yield might be poor due to the lack of rains on time,"" said Abdur Rouf, a grower in Rajosh. Habibur Rahaman Chowdhury, director (routine charge) of the field services wing of the DAE, said the agency suggested using irrigation pumps to ensure the timely cultivation of Aman. ""The situation is almost the same throughout the country. But transplantation begins early in the Rangpur and Dinajpur regions."" Md Shahjahan Kabir, director general of the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute, said seedlings of shortly matured varieties have to be transplanted within 15-20 days to ensure maximum output. ""If that exceeds, the yield will decline."" Similarly, dry weather will also affect the cultivation of long-duration rice varieties, he said, suggesting the operation of all public irrigation schemes to ensure timely cultivation to achieve the target. ""The government should initiate a massive agricultural rehabilitation programme under the current situation,"" said AMM Shawkat Ali, a former food adviser to the caretaker government. He said farmers should get an adequate supply of diesel for irrigation. ""It will offset the future need for import of food grains."" The rainfall may increase from today and the temperature will fall, according to Hafizur Rahman, a meteorologist at the BMD."
3074631,ECB to discuss 50bp rate hike this week,20-07-2022,/business/global-economy/news/ecb-discuss-50bp-rate-hike-week-3074631,business,"European Central Bank policymakers will discuss whether to raise interest rates by a bigger-than-expected 50 basis points at their meeting on Thursday to tame record-high inflation, two sources with direct knowledge of the discussion told Reuters. The sources said policymakers were also homing in on a deal to provide help for indebted countries like Italy on the bond market - provided they stick to European Commission rules on reforms and budget discipline. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the deliberations are private, added the discussion about whether to increase rates by 25 or 50 basis points was still wide open. Other major central banks have been raising rates in bigger increments, such as 75 or even 100 basis points, to contain surging inflation, raising the pressure on the ECB to do more. Policymakers were also homing in on a deal to provide help for indebted countries provided they stick to European Commission rules Policymakers were also homing in on a deal to provide help for indebted countries provided they stick to European Commission rules But a looming recession in the euro zone made some governors more cautious about choking off growth. An ECB spokesperson declined to comment, citing the bank's pre-meeting quiet period. The euro jumped on Tuesday after Reuters first reported that a 50 bp hike was under discussion, and was last up 0.9 per cent against the dollar at $1.0232. The single currency briefly fell below parity last week. Yields on euro zone government bonds also rose, with Germany's two-year benchmark now yielding 1.329 per cent. The ECB said on June 9 after its last meeting that it would raise interest rates gradually, probably by 25 basis points in July with a bigger move possible in September. But ECB chief Christine Lagarde later said there were ""clearly conditions in which gradualism would not be appropriate"". Euro zone inflation hit 8.6 per cent last month and is expected to keep rising until the autumn, driven by soaring fuel and food prices."
3074621,"Indian rupee plunges, hits  80 per dollar",20-07-2022,/business/global-economy/news/indian-rupee-plunges-hits-80-dollar-3074621,business,"The Indian rupee fell to more than 80 per US dollar for the first time on record Tuesday, as the greenback extended its rally and foreign capital outflows intensified. The rupee hit 80.0600 against the US dollar in early trade, Bloomberg data showed, before paring losses on suspected central bank intervention to close at 79.9487. High inflation and rising interest rates in the United States coupled with fears of an impending recession in the world's biggest economy have fuelled a broad dollar rally in recent weeks as investors become increasingly risk-averse. Tighter US monetary policy has exacerbated outflows from emerging markets such as India, where foreign investors have withdrawn a net $31 billion in debt and equity this year. Data released last week showed that US consumer price inflation hit a fresh four-decade high in June, exceeding market forecasts and stoking expectations of another large Federal Reserve rate hike next week. In a written statement to the Indian parliament on Monday, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman attributed the rupee's sharp fall to external reasons. ""Global factors such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, soaring crude oil prices and tightening of global financial conditions are the major reasons for the weakening of the Indian Rupee against the US dollar,"" she said. At the same time, the Indian currency has strengthened against the British pound, the Japanese yen and the euro in 2022 so far, Sitharaman added. But higher crude prices have resulted in a deteriorating trade balance in a country that imports 80 per cent of its oil. India's merchandise trade deficit widened to a record $26.18 billion in June, official data showed last week, largely because of higher crude and coal import prices. In its monthly economic review, the finance ministry said costlier imports could widen the current account deficit and cause the rupee to depreciate further. Consumer price inflation in India, the world's sixth-largest economy, cooled slightly to 7.01 per cent in June after hitting an eight-year high of 7.79 per cent in April. But price rises have persisted well above the central bank's two-to-six percent target range despite consecutive interest rate hikes in May and June. The central bank has also sold more than $34 billion of its foreign currency reserves in an effort to stabilise the rupee. ""The near-term outlook for the rupee will continue to be weak as it tracks developments on the oil and gas front in international markets,"" forex market expert K Harihar told AFP. ""The weakness will persist until trade deficit numbers come down or capital inflows counter it,"" he said, adding that the rupee could fall to 81 per US dollar without an agreement between Europe and Russia on gas supply. The rupee's move followed Russia's Gazprom telling Europe late Monday that it cannot guarantee gas supplies following maintenance work on its Nord Stream pipeline.

3074616,UAE inks energy deal with France ,20-07-2022,/business/global-economy/news/uae-inks-energy-deal-france-3074616,business,"France secured promises of new energy supplies from the United Arab Emirates on Monday after talks between President Emmanuel Macron and UAE leader Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan in Paris. The UAE has emerged as a key partner for Western countries as they scramble for energy deals worldwide to replace imports from sanctions-hit Russia. Sheikh Mohamed, also known as MBZ, was on his first overseas state visit since taking office in May following the death of his half-brother. After lunch between the two heads of state, a deal between French energy giant Total Energies and UAE state oil company ADNOC was signed  ""for cooperation in the area of energy supplies"". Macron's aides had said before the meeting that France was eager to secure diesel from the strategic Middle Eastern nation. ""The UAE is keen to support energy security in the world in general and in France in particular,"" Sheikh Mohamed told Macron, according to Emirati state news agency WAM. Before the trip, his diplomatic advisor Anwar Gargash had stressed how the UAE was looking to reorient its supplies towards Europe. ""We have sold our oil to the far east for 40 years and now we are directing it toward Europe in this time of crisis,"" he told reporters. The UAE president's visit to France came after Joe Biden's first Middle East tour as president, which included a visit to Saudi Arabia for energy talks. Macron and Biden were overheard talking about energy supplies from the Middle East at a G7 summit at the end of June in Germany. Macron told Biden that he had spoken to Sheikh Mohammed who had said he was at his  ""maximum"" in terms of oil production, but that the Saudis had some spare capacity. After his lunch with Macron, Sheikh Mohamed is set to be guest of honour at a dinner at the former royal palace in Versailles outside Paris. Human Rights Watch said Macron's  ""search for alternative supplies seems likely to reinforce France and the UAE's already close ties"". But the welcome in Paris  ""should not include giving the crown prince a pass on the UAE's atrocious human rights record"", it said in a statement on its website. The New York-based group pointed to the repression of political opposition, discrimination against the LGBTQ community, and the abuse of domestic workers. Western sanctions against the Russian energy sector following President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine mean many countries face shortfalls. Analysts warn about possible shortages later this year, particularly if Russia further reduces its gas exports to Europe."
3074611,US bank results highlight risk and resiliency,20-07-2022,/business/global-economy/news/us-bank-results-highlight-risk-and-resiliency-3074611,business,"Despite mounting worries over inflation, just-released bank earnings painted a resilient picture of the US economy and consumer, generating talk that any recession might be milder than earlier downturns. Reports from six US banking giants showed a significant drop in profits from the heady year-ago period, with most of the group establishing fresh provisions in case of defaults. Executives expressed caution about what's to come in light of the growing hit from higher gasoline and food prices, along with the burden of increased lending costs following several Federal Reserve interest rate hikes and persistent supply chain problems. But banks still haven't seen a significant rise in charge-offs from bad loans. They say many households still have a buffer of savings after conserving funds during the height of the pandemic when the federal government had generous relief programs. Citigroup Chief Financial Officer Jane Fraser noted  ""sharply lower"" consumer confidence compared with earlier in the year. ""That said, while sentiment has shifted, little of the data I see tells me the US is on the cusp of a recession,"" Fraser said Friday, adding that households savings provided  ""a cushion for future stress"" amid a tight job market. Fraser contrasted the backdrop in the United States with Europe, where vulnerability to Russian energy could make for a  ""difficult winter."" Executives acknowledged that the rising price of fuel and other essential goods poses burden to low-income households who are cutting back.  But most of the bank's clients are not in this situation now. ""US consumers remain quite resilient,"" Bank of America Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said Monday.  ""Consumers continue to spend at a healthy pace even as some time has passed since the receipt of any stimulus."" JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive described the consumer as  ""in great shape,"" which means that even if there is a recession, they're entering it in  ""far better shape"" compared with 2008 or 2009. On Monday Bank of America reported $6.2 billion in second-quarter profits, a 34 per cent drop compared with the year-ago period when results were lifted by a large reserve release amid a strengthening macroeconomic backdrop. In spite of weakness in some parts of the business, results were boosted by higher net interest income following Fed rate hikes. Bank of America also enjoyed growth in overall loans and pointed to  ""improvement"" in overall asset quality. At Goldman Sachs -- the final of the US banking giants to report -- profits fell 48 per cent to $2.8 billion, again due in part to its decision to set aside $667 million in provisions for credit losses. Operations were mixed, with a big jump in revenues tied to trading amid volatile markets offsetting the hit from a drop in revenues connected to mergers and acquisition advising and loan underwriting. The reports came on the heels of similar releases last week from JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo. Stuart Plesser, a senior director at S&P Global Ratings described the industry's overall tone as muted. ""They're not saying anything's disastrous, they're not optimistic, either,"" Plesser said. ""If you read the news, you got this possibility with inflation, the higher rate increases and all the other issues, but you can't point to anything in the results,"" he added."

The comments by the IEA's director Fatih Birol came as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen signed an energy deal in Baku, under which deliveries of Azerbaijani gas will double over the next few years. But Birol said in an article published by the IEA:  ""It is categorically not enough to just rely on gas from non-Russian sources -- these supplies are simply not available in the volumes required to substitute for missing deliveries from Russia. Europe has been seeking to import more LNG to replace some Russian gas, but it has a limited number of terminals to offload it


 Europe has been seeking to import more LNG to replace some Russian gas, but it has a limited number of terminals to offload it ""This will be the case even if gas supplies from Norway and Azerbaijan flow at maximum capacity, if deliveries from North Africa stay close to last year's levels, if domestic gas production in Europe continues to follow recent trends, and if inflows of LNG increase at a similar record rate as they did in the first half of this year,"" he added. Europe is also waiting to see this week if Russia resumes gas shipments via Gazprom's key Nord Stream 1 pipeline, on which 10 days of scheduled maintenance will soon be completed. It has been seeking to import more liquefied natural gas (LNG) to replace some Russian gas, but it has a limited number of terminals to offload it from tankers and supplies are also limited. While the EU has not put Russian natural gas under sanctions over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, it has sought to cut imports so as to reduce its dependence on Moscow. Russia has already cited various reasons for cutting energy supplies to the west. European nations now want to see it resumes gas shipments via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline on Thursday, when compressor maintenance is due end. ""Europe is now forced to operate in a constant state of uncertainty over Russian gas supplies, and we can't rule out a complete cut-off,"" said Birol."

The disbursement deadline was set for June 30, 2022. Now, the facility for the members of the Bangladesh Textile Mills Association and the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association has been extended to December 31, according to a notice of the central bank. This is the third extension. The size of the EDF stands at $7 billion. In another notice, the central bank asked banks not to disburse loans from the EDF among the clients if they fail to repay from their export earnings. In June, the BB asked banks to refrain from forwarding applications of EDF loans, irrespective of the nature of imports, for customers whose liabilities have been settled through funded facilities in the immediate past 180 days. Yesterday, it said the EDF loans are required to be settled out of export proceeds/foreign currency funds. So, it has been decided that the customers whose EDF liabilities have to be settled through funded facilities will not be accessible for further loans under the scheme from now onwards, the BB added. Funded facilities are loans where banks and financial institutions provide real cash to their clients."

3075206,The secret to Kings’ domestic success,20-07-2022,/sports/football/news/the-secret-kings-domestic-success-3075206,sports,"Though promoted football clubs usually struggle to survive in country's top-tier football league, Bashundhara Kings have bucked the trend and have made a piece of history too with a third consecutive Bangladesh Premier League title. Having started their top-flight journey in 2018-19 season, Kings have already matched the success of Abahani, who had won the title three times in a row in the first three editions of the league. What separated Kings from promoted clubs, according to the club's technical director BA Jubair Nipu, is the professionalism in managing players, no-interference from the management and inspiration and determination to achieve something big. ""The club president has been conducting Bashundhara Kings professionally and he makes no interference in technical matters, unlike other clubs. He has instructed the team management to make sure no player can raise complaints about anything. He always inspires players to reach their destination even in troubled times,"" Nipu told The Daily Star. Money, undoubtedly, has been a big factor behind the success of Kings, who have signed most of the national team players with big offers alongside from spending huge sums on foreign recruits. ""The president even announced bonus without any reason during international competitions. So the players are always eager to perform,"" said Nipu, who has been with Kings since their debut season. Captain Tapu Barman echoed the sentiment of the technical director and shed light on aspects which worked behind their success. ""Why do most players want to play for Bashundhara Kings? The answer is money. Bashundhara Kings paid 100 per cent of payment as per contract before the end of the season. This boosts the players mentally,"" Tapu told The Daily Star. ""Actually good planning helped Bashundhara Kings win three titles in a row. The club management has the ability to bring out the best from the players by motivating them in different ways. The players can preserve same level of energy and strength till the end of the season because of proper diet and good training facilities. The coaching staff help the players stay injury-free round the year, so they can perform at any time,"" explained Tapu, who joined the outfit in 2019-20 season from Abahani. ""For instance, it is must for every Kings player to have protein shake after training, but I always used to buy it with my own money while playing for other clubs,"" Tapu said. ""This season was really tough for us because we lost the Independence Cup to Abahani and two players, including myself, were ruled out of the season due to injury. Kings also started the league with a defeat against Swadhinata KS, so it was really tough to bounce back in the league but the players showed their character in rest of the season and the management backed them in different ways including announcing big bonuses for some crucial matches."" The national team defender also informed that they were waiting for a big bonus for clinching the ha-trick league title as the club management has promised to clear it before their next match against Abahani. The club is also preparing to celebrate their latest success after that match at the Bashundhara Kings area."

Babar Azam's side successfully chased down 342 runs to complete an extraordinary four-wicket triumph over Sri Lanka on Wednesday, 20 July, and in the process boosted their chances of appearing in next year's World Test Championship final. The win sees Pakistan jump in front of Sri Lanka and into third place on the World Test Championship standings with a win-loss percentage of 58.33 percent, with only South Africa (71.43%) and Australia (70%) now ahead of the Asian side. The news isn't as good for Sri Lanka, who drop three places to sixth on the standings with a 48.15 win-loss percentage. As a result, India improve one spot to fourth (52.08%) and West Indies rise to fifth (50%) ahead of the second Test between Sri Lanka and Pakistan in Galle next week. A win there will see Pakistan make further ground on South Africa and Australia at the top of the standings, while a loss will see Babar's side drop back to fifth. Conversely, Sri Lanka can regain third place on the standings if they can recover quickly, fight back and level the series by winning the second Test."

Star forwards Messi, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe all started in new PSG manager Christophe Galtier's first game in charge of his full squad in front of a crowd of 65,000 at Tokyo's National Stadium. Messi opened the scoring with a 32nd-minute shot but a much-changed PSG line-up in the second half could manage only one more goal through substitute Arnaud Kalimuendo. J-League champions Kawasaki pulled a goal back in the 84th minute when Kazuya Yamamura headed home unmarked to set up a nervy finish. PSG will play two more J-League sides on their Japanese tour, taking on Urawa Reds in Saitama on Saturday and Gamba Osaka in Osaka the following Monday. PSG had most of the early possession but the first real chance fell to Kawasaki. A pass forward split the PSG defence and released striker Marcinho, only for the Brazilian to put the ball wide with the goal at his mercy. Kawasaki goalkeeper Jung Song-ryong denied Mbappe a minute later after Messi had played him in on goal. Kawasaki's Chanathip Songkrasin -- nicknamed the ""Thai Messi"" -- then cleared a shot from his Argentine namesake off the line to keep the game scoreless. But Messi found a way through shortly after, guiding a shot into the corner from just inside the box. Neymar and Mbappe departed at half-time and Kawasaki forward Kei Chinen missed a glorious chance to equalise when he blazed over the bar in the 50th minute. Messi bowed out soon after as Galthier, newly arrived from Nice, rung the changes. Substitute Kalimuendo doubled PSG's lead when he turned home Juan Bernat's low cross in the 58th minute, before Yamamura pulled one back with six minutes left to play."

Barcelona have struggled financially in recent seasons, but were able to seal the signature of two-time FIFA player of the year Lewandowski in a 45-million-euro ($46 million) deal. The Catalan giants also signed Brazilian winger Raphinha from Leeds for a reported 55 million euros and have brought centre-back Andreas Christensen and former AC Milan midfielder Franck Kessie to the Camp Nou on free transfers. ""They bought a lot of players, I don't know how,"" Nagelsmann told a press conference in Washington during his side's pre-season tour of the United States.

Lewandowski, whose contract was due to finish next year, had said in May ""it is certain that my story with Bayern has come to an end"". The 33-year-old Pole left the club after scoring 344 goals in an eight-year spell and netting more than 40 times in seven straight seasons. ""It was a good deal for Bayern,"" admitted Nagelsmann. ""It's tough. He scored a lot of goals and was one of Bayern's big stars. ""But he would've left anyway, if it wasn't this season, it would've been the next one, so we would've had that challenge a year later and that's why the deal isn't so bad for Bayern."" Bayern, who won a 10th successive Bundesliga title last season, have signed Senegal forward Sadio Mane from Liverpool during the close season. They also completed a 67-million-euro deal to snap up Dutch defender Matthijs de Ligt from Juventus and brought former Ajax pair Ryan Gravenberch and Noussair Mazraoui to the Allianz Arena. It is not the first time Bayern have hit out at Barca.

In March 2021, Barcelona said they were suffering from huge debts, cash flow problems and a large wage bill. They have since spread the debt, taken out a new loan from Goldman Sachs and signed deals worth several million euros, most notably with music streaming giant Spotify."

""I think if I was an opposition captain or an opposition player, I will be fearing playing an Indian team that has Virat Kohli in it, more than I would be one that doesn't have him in it,"" Ponting said while speaking on The ICC Review. Ponting, who captained Australia to two World Cup triumphs in 2003 and 2007, said Kohli still had the ability to have a meaningful impact. ""And somehow, the best (players) find a way to rebound and respond, and it's only a matter of time before Virat does that.""

The tourists began an intriguing final day needing 120 runs with seven wickets in hand to go 1-0 ahead in the two-Test series. Pakistan went on to accomplish their second highest successful chase of 342 riding Shafique's career-best knock, which included seven fours and a six. ""As a youngster, he showed his class and temperament,"" Pakistan captain Babar Azam said of Shafique whose 480-ball vigil earned him the man-of-the-match award. Pakistan also jumped ahead of Sri Lanka in the World Test Championship standings with only South Africa (71.43%) and Australia (70%) above them. In-form Prabath Jayasuriya was Sri Lanka's best bet on a worn-out pitch and the left-arm spinner, who claimed 5-82 in the first innings, began the proceedings for the hosts on the final day. He nearly struck with the first delivery of the day which breached Mohammad Rizwan's (40) defence but somehow missed the stumps. The spinner, who claimed 12 wickets in his test debut against Australia at the same venue earlier this month, repeatedly beat the bat but had to wait for success. Sri Lanka wasted both remaining reviews challenging not-out decisions against Shafique and Rizwan off Jayasuriya's bowling. Jayasuriya (4-135) finally broke the 71-run stand dismissing Rizwan lbw with a ball that kept low and went straight. Agha Salman and Hasan Ali fell cheaply but Sri Lanka's faint hopes of an unlikely victory evaporated when Kasun Rajitha dropped Shafique at deep square leg. Pakistan were 11 runs away when rain intervened and Shafique sealed Pakistan's victory with a boundary when play resumed. The indefatigable Jayasuriya bowled 56.2 overs in the second innings and finished with a match-haul of nine wickets.

Left-arm spinner Prabath Jayasuriya took a match haul of nine wickets but his efforts were in vain as Pakistan battled past the previous best chase in Galle of 268 by Sri Lanka against New Zealand in 2019. The 22-year-old Shafique excelled with his second Test ton. He built crucial partnerships including a 101-run third-wicket stand with skipper Babar Azam, who made 55 after his 119 in the first innings on a tricky pitch to bat on. Shafique finally combined with Mohammad Nawaz, 19 not out, to take the visitors home after a brief rain interruption halted their charge. The teams had taken early tea before returning for the third session of play. Shafique survived three dropped catches, on 70, 135 and 151, but played the anchor's role to perfection as he surpassed his previous Test best of 136 not out. Pakistan had a few anxious moments after Jayasuriya, who sent back talisman Azam before the close on day four, struck at the stroke of lunch to get debutant Salman Ali Agha out for 12. Hasan Ali fell for five in the second over of the second session after being promoted up the order to hit out the remaining runs. Jayasuriya, who took 12 wickets on debut in a series-levelling Test win over Australia last week at the same venue, six in each innings, kept up the pressure but Shafique stood firm. Pakistan resumed the day on 222-3 and Sri Lanka soon used up their remaining two umpire reviews, with Jayasuriya involved in both calls. Mohammad Rizwan opened his day's account with a boundary off Ramesh Mendis and kept up his positive intent by taking singles and twos before he fell lbw to Jayasuriya for 40. A review did not save Rizwan, a wicketkeeper-batsman who has come into the two-match series after a successful stint with English county Sussex. Dinesh Chandimal kept up his blazing form in an unbeaten 94 -- his second successive half-century -- when he ran out of partners in Sri Lanka's second-innings total of 337. In a match of tail-end fightbacks, Azam hit a defiant century in Pakistan's first innings and batted patiently with the lower order after the visitors slipped to 85-7 on day two. The second Test starts Sunday, also in Galle, after it was moved from Colombo due to the political unrest in Sri Lanka."

Van der Dussen's career-best 134 was the cornerstone of South Africa's 335-5, their highest ODI total in England, and he also shared stands of 109 with opener Janneman Malan (57) and 151 with Aiden Markram, who made a stylish 77. Test captain Stokes did not have a fairytale finish to a 50-over international cricket career that peaked with a player of the match display in England's 2019 World Cup final triumph. The struggling 31-year-old paceman took an expensive 0-44 in five overs amid searing heat, after being cheered by his loyal fans as he led England onto the field. Stokes then made just five with the bat before he was lbw to off-spinner Markram having missed a reverse sweep. Joe Root, a close friend of Stokes since their days playing youth cricket, took up the charge with a run-a-ball fifty. But a target of 103 off the last eight overs, with England already six wickets down, was too much even for Root. The world's top-ranked Test batsman was eventually bowled for an excellent 86 by express quick Anrich Nortje, who finished with 4-53 from 8.5 overs. England openers Jason Roy (43) and Jonny Bairstow (63) had launched the 50-over world champions' chase with a partnership of 102 in 19 overs. But that stand ended when Roy, looking to loft Proteas captain Keshav Maharaj, chipped the left-arm spinner and David Miller, running round from long-off, held a good low catch. Bairstow, having completed a 53-ball fifty, was reprieved when Lungi Ngidi dropped a routine chance at long leg only to be lbw soon afterwards on the sweep to Markram. And after Markram snared Stokes, slow bowling proved the undoing of England captain Jos Buttler as well, with the dangerman caught and bowled for 12 by Tabraiz Shamsi after an inside edge onto his pad lobbed back low to the diving left-arm wrist-spinner. Stokes had announced on Monday that this game would be his 105th and last match at this level, with the dynamic all-rounder saying the demands of a congested England fixture schedule meant he had to jettison ODIs in order to still give of his best in Tests and Twenty20s. England, who lost the third ODI, and with it a three-match series, against India at Old Trafford on Sunday, gave a 50-over debut to Matthew Potts after the Durham seamer made an impressive Test bow against New Zealand last month. - Potts falters in the heat -
But on a day where temperatures touched 37-degrees, Potts bowled just four overs before leaving the field due to the heat after Maharaj, skipper in place of the injured Temba Bavuma, had won the toss and unsurprisingly opted to bat first in this day/night match. Following the early loss of Quinton de Kock, South Africa's second-wicket duo were eventually separated when Malan holed out against off-spinner Moeen Ali. But van der Dussen's leg-glanced boundary off Curran saw him to a 90-ball hundred including nine fours. It was the 33-year-old's third century in 36 ODIs and first against England. Van der Dussen, dropped on 121 when Bairstow failed to hold a difficult low running chance at midwicket, went on to surpass his previous highest ODI score of 129 not out against India at Paarl in January this year. He was bowled by a Livingstone delivery that kept low two balls after the spinner dismissed Markram. The series continues at Old Trafford on Friday."

Fellow World Cup-winner Jos Buttler, now England's white-ball captain, thanked Stokes for his ODI efforts. ""Three years ago (the 2019 World Cup final) will live long in the memory but every day he turns up, whether that be for training or in a match, he puts in 100 percent. ""He has been a fantastic ambassador for us in ODI cricket. We will miss him."" Joe Root took up the charge after Stokes's dismissal with a run-a-ball fifty. But a target of 103 off the last eight overs, with England already six wickets down, was too much even for the world's top-ranked Test batsman. Root was eventually bowled for an excellent 86 by express quick Anrich Nortje, who finished with 4-53 from 8.5 overs. ""The boys were really clinical today,"" South Africa captain Keshav Maharaj told Sky Sports. ""Rassie set the tone with the bat and then the bowlers stuck really well to their plans so full credit to everyone for their performances."" On a day where temperatures touched 37-degrees, it was no surprise Maharaj, skipper in place of the injured Temba Bavuma, opted to bat first after winning the toss. ""We didn't expect a heatwave in England to quite be this hot, it was quite nostalgic, like being at home!,"" said Maharaj. Conditions, however, took their toll on England ODI debutant Matthew Potts, called up after the recent 2-1 series loss to India, who bowled just four overs before leaving the field due to the heat. England openers Jason Roy (43) and Jonny Bairstow (63) had launched the 50-over world champions' chase with a partnership of 102 in 19 overs.

Slow bowling also proved the undoing of Buttler, caught and bowled for 12 by left-arm wrist-spinner Tabraiz Shamsi. Buttler, proud of the way England fielded in the extreme heat, said: ""We just couldn't quite find those breakthroughs, couldn't break that fantastic Van der Dussen-Markram partnership. In the chase, we never managed to quite impose ourselves with the bat."" Earlier, van der Dussen's leg-glanced boundary off Curran saw him to a 90-ball hundred including nine fours.

3074501,AGM clears way for formation of RCAs,20-07-2022,/sports/cricket/news/agm-clears-way-formation-rcas-3074501,sports,"The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) made two major amendments to its constitution during its Annual General Meeting (AGM) at a city hotel yesterday, the first enabling the formation of Regional Cricket Associations (RCA) while the other cut down the councillorship from two to one for the Super League clubs. Establishing Regional Cricket Associations (RCA) was one of Nazmul Hassan Papon's foremost goals before being elected president of the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) for the first time in 2013. ""The BCB will provide directions and delegate responsibility. A total of eight RCAs will be formed with councillors and directors in Rajshahi, Sylhet, Mymensingh, Barishal, Dhaka, Rangpur, Chattogram and Khulna. For bigger divisions, we will have 17 members and for smaller regions, we will have eleven members,"" Hassan told the media yesterday. However, it will be important to see how the BCB will form the structure of the RCA in the coming days. ""We will sort everything out at the first board meeting and then we can inform in detail. So far, the BCB will nominate and provide guidelines. Once the guidelines are set and RCAs formed, you will get answers to everything,"" he said. The changes to the councillorship come after lingering questions about why the six Super League clubs of the Dhaka Premier League held two councillorships. ""We wanted there to be stronger teams apart from Abahani and Mohammedan. Now almost all the clubs are strong. You don't see Abahani or Mohammedan winning the title. We see other clubs such as Sheikh Jamal, Legends of Rupganj and others. ""Our aim was to return to one councillorship. Bangladesh cricket has reached a point where there won't be any dissatisfaction from anyone even if we give every club one councillorship. In fact, they should be happy. Those who were present at the AGM all welcomed the decision. But the clubs which saw their numbers go down won't be satisfied,"" he said. According to many, the reason behind cutting down the councillorship had to do with the fact that the current board had gained the trust of all the clubs so the decrease in councillorship would not harm the Hassan-led board in the next election. ""Our main intention was that an extra vote would be like an extra incentive to make clubs more competitive for the championships and in preparing teams. Since other clubs -- not only Abahani and Mohammedan -- are fighting for the championship, I think the main objective has been served,"" Hassan added."
3074486,Stokes hopes to prolong career,20-07-2022,/sports/cricket/news/stokes-hopes-prolong-career-3074486,sports,"Ben Stokes said on Tuesday he was retiring from one-day internationals earlier than planned as the England Test captain hopes it will prolong his career into his mid-30s. The all-rounder made his 105th and final ODI appearance against South Africa on Tuesday -- a match that took place at his Durham home ground. Before his farewell match, 32-year-old Stokes reiterated his warning about England's gruelling schedule. ""The schedule for me feels unsustainable,"" Stokes told Sky Sports News shortly before Tuesday's toss. ""I didn't like the feeling of not being able to contribute in the way I wanted to -- as an all-rounder I wanted to contribute with the bat and ball."" He added: ""When I thought about it long and hard, I felt I don't feel I can do that in all three formats. I always knew that at some point I would have to choose one of the white-ball formats."""
3074481,Mahmudullah captaincy brings the Shakib question,20-07-2022,/sports/cricket/news/mahmudullah-captaincy-brings-the-shakib-question-3074481,sports,"Bangladesh's upcoming tour of Zimbabwe for three T20Is and as many ODIs was expected to be a humdrum affair, but the importance of the series changed due to Bangladesh Cricket Board's (BCB) insistence that the team to go in a different direction in terms of performance and approach in the shortest format. ""It is high time for a change,"" a BCB source, wishing to be anonymous, told The Daily Star yesterday when asked about the leadership of the T20I side and the direction the board wanted to take. The impetus to change is not only coming from one or two of the BCB higher-ups, but some of the key decision-makers in the board. It was learned that Mahmudullah Riyad is set to be rested for the tour as the BCB feels the need for change to the side that played in the West Indies. The Tigers lost the T20I series 2-0 in the Caribbean and the approach of the team did not gather any momentum following the T20 World Cup debacle in the UAE under Riyad's leadership. Although BCB president Nazmul Hassan said that he would hold talks with Riyad after the team's return from the West Indies, sources close to the board are of the understanding that a change in captaincy in the T20 format is just a formality. The precedent was set after Mominul Haque stepped down from Test captaincy owing to a run of poor performances with the bat. Riyad's form has also been under scrutiny as he has yet to have a major contribution with the bat since the World Cup in UAE. ""It's not just that he has not scored runs. The manner in which he is applying himself with the bat is also impacting the team and is a major cause for concern,"" a BCB director told The Daily Star yesterday on condition of anonymity. Riyad's absence in the T20I series in Zimbabwe is being disguised as rest out of respect towards the veteran player, but with the T20 World Cup on the horizon, who are the BCB looking at? It was learned that all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan had been earmarked to take on captaincy. But as Shakib was slated to be rested for the Zimbabwe series, the BCB are now pondering whether the left-hander should be on the Zimbabwe tour to get his ideas across sooner rather than later. Why Shakib? While the BCB passively admit that carrying on with Riyad might have been a mistake, why do they feel Shakib can make a difference? ""Only Shakib [among the seniors] has the tendency to make sure that youngsters keep growing and take on meaningful roles in the side,"" a source close to BCB decision-makers said. It was learned that Nurul Hasan Sohan could be handed captaincy on an interim basis if Shakib remains unavailable for the Zimbabwe tour. In case Shakib is included, Sohan may get the nod as vice-captain of the T20I outfit. BCB are also looking at all the upcoming major events with an eye on Shakib leading the side. Team director Khaled Mahmud said just a day prior to Shakib being handed Test captaincy this year that ""if Shakib asked, he could lead in all three formats"". There is much time before the ODI World Cup in India in 2023, but for now it appears that all roads may lead to Shakib."

The 21-year-old was diagnosed with a minor heart condition in January following a COVID-19 infection in December, and did not play in a competitive game for Bayern until April. He also missed out on Canada's CONCACAF World Cup qualifiers.  ""That was very scary, especially (because) the doctors are saying that they don't know how long I was supposed to be out,"" Davies told ESPN on Tuesday. ""I think that was the scariest part. ""At that time I had doubts in my head, whether I'm still going to be able to play football, but everything worked out at the end. I'm happy and I'm grateful to the doctor for taking such good care of me. ""I'm happy that I can be back on the pitch."" Looking ahead to the coming season, Davies said Bayern will miss striker Robert Lewandowski, who joined LaLiga side Barcelona this week, but added that the signing of Sadio Mane from Liverpool will help fill the void left by the Polish striker.  ""(Mane) is a good player, he's a big piece to (add to) the team,"" Davies said. ""So we're excited to have him and we're looking forward to what he can bring to this team. ""An important piece left, but also an important piece arrived.""

Mane was a key figure in the Senegal team that defeated Salah-captained Egypt in the 2021/2022 Africa Cup of Nations final and in a 2022 World Cup play-off. Both the African title decider in Cameroon and the Qatar eliminator in Senegal were won by the Teranga Lions after penalty shootouts. Mane scored in each shootout while the final was decided before Salah could take his kick, and he blazed wide in the play-off. The Senegalese successes have made Mane favourite to win a second straight Player of the Year award after 2019 -- the following two editions were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. Should Mane win in the Moroccan capital, he will become the first Bayern Munich star to be voted the top African footballer. The closest a player from the German giants has come to winning was in 1999 and 2001 when Ghanaian Samuel Kuffour finished second. Mane moved to Bayern last month on a three-year deal after joining Liverpool in 2016 from Southampton and Anfield boss Jurgen Klopp calls him ""a complete forward"". ""My only criticism of Sadio is that maybe at times he is the only one not to realise just how good he is."" Liverpool defender Andy Robertson hailed the predatory instincts of the 30-year-old: ""Whenever he is in front of the goal you do not think he will miss."" Salah lifted the award in 2017 and 2018 and the victory of Mane the following year raised to four the number of winners from Liverpool with another Senegalese, El Hadji Diouf, topping the 2002 vote.   South Africans dominate women hopefuls 
The Egyptian had an outstanding 2021-2022 season for the Reds, sharing the Golden Boot award with South Korean Son Heung-min of Tottenham Hotspur. Salah was voted Premier League Player of the Season by both the Professional Footballers' Association and the Football Writers' Association. Algeria captain and Manchester City winger Riyad Mahrez is the other former winner among the 10 nominees having come first in 2016 after helping rank outsiders Leicester City become Premier League champions. Mahrez and Algeria have struggled lately, however, with the defending champions making a humiliating first round exit from the Cup of Nations, then losing a World Cup play-off against Cameroon. The 10 candidates for the Club Player of the Year include Brazilian Tiago Azulao, whose chart-topping seven goals in the CAF Champions League took Angolan outfit Petro Luanda to a surprise semi-finals spot. South Africans dominate the Women's Player of the Year nominees with 2018 winner Thembi Kgatlana, Andile Dlamini, Refiloe Jane and Bambanani Mbane among 10 hopefuls. Ghana, notable absentees from the ongoing Women's Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco after losing a first round qualifier against Nigeria, have two representatives, Evelyn Badu and Doris Boaduwaa. Nigeria, the powerhouse of women's football in Africa for decades, have one candidate, highly decorated Asisat Oshoala, who plays for 2022 European Champions League runners-up Barcelona. Ruled out of the Cup of Nations in Morocco by injury, Oshoala has been voted African Player of the Year four times, most recently in 2019. Choosing the best women's national team will be delayed until after the Cup of Nations final between Morocco and South Africa in Rabat on Saturday. African football legends, CAF technical committee members, coaches and captains of national teams and of some clubs and selected media pick the winners."

With Polish superstar striker Robert Lewandowski yet to play following his move from Bayern Munich for 50 million euros ($51 million), it was the 25-year-old Brazilian forward who led Xavi Hernandez's side to an easy win against the MLS club that is owned by former England international David Beckham. Raphinha - who signed for 58 million euros from Leeds United earlier this month - first assisted Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who opened the scoring in 19th minute, and then extended the lead himself six minutes later with a nice left foot first touch strike. Spanish teenage sensation Ansu Fati, who is slowly working his way back into form after a long layoff after a series of injuries, scored Barca's third right before halftime with another pass from Raphinha. Barca came back to the second half with eleven substitutions but kept dominating and scored three more through Gavi, Memphis Depay and Ousmane Dembele. It was Barca's first of four games in their U.S. preseason tour that will continue on Saturday with a Clasico against bitter rivals Real Madrid in Las Vegas. ""I think we are better than Real Madrid,"" Raphinha told reporters. ""I'm very happy to score my first goal and for things having turned out well in my debut. I felt very good.

Sky Sports said Arsenal will pay 30 million pounds up front with two million pounds in add-ons, with the 25-year-old leaving City's training camp in America to link up with the London side who are also on a U.S. pre-season tour. Zinchenko will become Arsenal's second recruit from City in the close season -- after Brazil striker Gabriel Jesus -- and their fifth signing overall after winger Marquinhos, goalkeeper Matt Turner and attacking midfielder Fabio Vieira. A Shakhtar Donetsk youth product, Zinchenko began his senior career in the Russian Premier League with Ufa before signing for City in 2016 as a 19-year-old after playing for Ukraine at the 2016 European Championship. Primarily a midfielder when on international duty, Zinchenko has often been deployed as a left back by Pep Guardiola at City. But he has found playing time hard to come by with Joao Cancelo the preferred option on the left side of defence. Zinchenko has played 52 times for Ukraine, scoring eight times. For City, he has made 127 appearances in all competitions, including the 2021 Champions League final where City finished runners-up to Chelsea. He has won four Premier League titles, four League Cups and one FA Cup with City. Zinchenko's arrival will give Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta squad depth in the left back position with Nuno Tavares failing to impress last season when first choice defender Kieran Tierney's season came to a premature end due to injury. Arsenal, who finished fifth last season, begin their league campaign on Aug. 5 with a London derby at Crystal Palace."

3074201,China to host Asian Games in Sept-Oct 2023,19-07-2022,/sports/more-sports/news/china-host-asian-games-oct-2023-3074201,sports,"China will host the 2022 Asian Games in 2023, organisers said on Tuesday, after postponing the event in Hangzhou because of Covid. The Games will now be held in Hangzhou from September 23 to October 8 2023, the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) said. The event was originally scheduled to be held in September this year, but organisers in May postponed it as China tried to stamp out a large Covid resurgence in several parts of the country. Hangzhou lies less than 200 kilometres (120 miles) from the country's biggest city Shanghai, which endured a months-long lockdown earlier this year as part of the ruling Communist Party's zero-tolerance approach to the virus. The OCA said on Tuesday that the new dates were chosen to avoid ""conflict with other major international sporting events"". The Asian Games typically attract over 10,000 athletes from across the region. China is the last major economy committed to stamping out domestic spread of the virus through harsh lockdowns, mass testing and strict controls on international travel. But that has hurt the country's international sporting ambitions, with the world's most populous nation cancelling or postponing almost all events since the start of the pandemic, with the exception of this year's Winter Olympics in Beijing. The World University Games, scheduled to begin in June in Chengdu and already delayed from last year, have also been postponed again, until 2023."
3074031,Ashleigh Barty rules out golf as a career,19-07-2022,/sports/tennis/news/ashleigh-barty-rules-out-golf-career-3074031,sports,"Former tennis world number one Ashleigh Barty has dashed hopes she will make a return to professional sport, after speculation the Australian could switch to golf. The 25-year-old three-time Grand Slam winner stunned the sporting world with her bombshell retirement in March, just weeks after becoming the first home Australian Open champion in 44 years. Barty had been coy on what she would do next, but has always been a keen golfer, winning the Brookwater Golf Club women's title near Brisbane in 2020 and playing the Icons Series exhibition in the United States in April. It heightened speculation that the multi-talented Australian, who has also been a professional cricketer, could take up golf seriously. But in an interview with Melbourne radio late Monday she put the rumours to bed, ruling out playing any form of professional sport again. ""You guys just can't accept that I don't want to play professional sport any more,"" Barty said. ""I love golf, it's a hobby of mine. It will not be my profession, I have no intention of making it my profession but I hack around once a week if I can. ""There's no need, there's no desire for me to play professional sport, particularly golf,"" she added. ""I love it as a walkaround with my girlfriends and friends but yeah, not for me."" Late last year Barty became engaged to long-term boyfriend Garry Kissick and since her retirement has released a series of 'Little Ash' children books. ""Supporting kids' education is something I'm passionate about and if I can help encourage new readers that will make me very happy,"" she said last month."
3073571,"‘Jeez, what a week’",19-07-2022,/sports/tennis/news/jeez-what-week-3073571,sports,"Australian Cameron Smith was almost lost for words after shooting a flawless closing 64 to win the 150th British Open on Sunday. The 28-year-old world number six overhauled a four-shot deficit to claim his maiden major title, becoming the first Australian to lift the Claret Jug since Greg Norman in 1993. ""Jeez, what a week. It's unreal to look at the names on this trophy and then see mine... I'm lost for words,"" he said after receiving the trophy. ""I'm going to fall apart here I know. I want to thank the team here for all their hard work, and this one makes it worth it. ""To the R&A - a fantastic week, to St Andrews Links and everyone involved - it was absolutely awesome out there. ""The course was exactly how an Open championship should be played."" A large group of Australians in the crowd celebrated wildly, a week after they had watched Nick Kyrgios lose the Wimbledon tennis final to Novak Djokovic. ""Lastly to you guys the fans - I had a lot of support out there, especially the Aussie guys,"" Smith said. ""You guys really kept me going. Seemed like that there was a lot of you guys and you kept me plugging away. This one's for Oz."""

Smith, winner of golf's unofficial fifth major, The Players Championship, earlier this year, carded a sensational final round eight-under 64 that included a spectacular run of five consecutive birdies from the turn to become the first Australian to hoist the Claret Jug since Greg Norman in 1993. The 28-year-old Queenslander also became the first Australian man to claim one of golf's four majors since Jason Day's victory at the 2015 PGA Championship. ""All the names on there, every player that's been at the top of their game has won this championship,"" said Smith, adding he had no plans to get rid of his famous mullet hairstyle. ""It's pretty cool to be on there. ""It really hasn't sunk in yet. I don't think it will for a few weeks."" Smith's winning total of 20-under 268 was one better than playing partner American Cameron Young, who eagled the last for a 65 to finish alone in second while McIlroy, the betting favourite coming into St Andrews, faltered at the finish to settle for third. McIlroy started the final round tied for the lead with Viktor Hovland four strokes clear of the pack and an end to his eight-year major drought looked in sight as he moved two shots ahead alone in first. The four-time major winner's conservative game plan had appeared to work to perfection as he carded an error free two-under 70. But in the end fortune favoured the brave as Smith's go-for-broke approach ended with him being crowned Champion Golfer of the Year. It was another cruel near miss for McIlroy who now has top-10 finishes in all four of this season's majors, adding a third place at St Andrews to a runner-up result at the Masters and a fifth-placed finish at the U.S. Open. ""I felt like I didn't do much wrong today, but I didn't do much right either,"" summed up McIlroy. ""It's just one of those days where I played a really controlled round of golf. ""I did what I felt like I needed to. At the end of the day, it's not life or death. ""It's one that I feel like I let slip away, but there will be other opportunities."" LOW SCORES As McIlroy and Hovland set out under overcast skies they no doubt noticed the low scores put up by early starters like Sadom Kaewkanjana of Thailand and Mexico's Abraham Ancer who were in the clubhouse with seven-under 65s. For Smith and Young the message was received -- the Claret Jug was still within reach. The world number two had preached patience the entire week and was doing just that as he reached the turn without a bogey, a single birdie good enough to keep him two shots ahead of a trio of challengers -- Hovland, Smith and Young. Yet while McIlroy was practising patience, Smith was mounting a devastating all-out attack, firing five straight birdies to start the back nine, knocking McIlroy from the top of the leaderboard. ""I sometimes think that being behind on certain golf courses and in certain situations is maybe a good thing,"" said Smith. ""I think it's very easy to get defensive out there and keep hitting it to 60, 70 feet, and you can make pars all day, but you're not going to make birdies. ""I think it was a good thing that I was definitely behind. ""I think my mindset would have been a touch different coming in, especially on that back nine, if I was ahead."" One more birdie at the 18th and all that was left for Smith to do was to wait and see if McIlroy, playing the pair behind him, could eagle the last to force a playoff. Smith was not celebrating just yet, knowing anything was possible having watched Young roll in a 15-foot eagle putt at the 18th to join him momentarily on 19-under, until he drained his short birdie to clinch the Jug. The 28-year-old earned $2.5 million for his win but that could be only a small fraction of the fortune awaiting him if media reports are true that he is about to sign on with the big-money Saudi-backed LIV Golf Invitational Series. LIV Golf has poached several top golfers away from the PGA Tour, luring them to the rebel circuit with multi-million dollar guaranteed contracts. Smith batted away questions about joining them saying he leaves that business to his team. ""I don't know, mate. My team around me worries about all that stuff,"" said Smith. ""I'm here to win golf tournaments."""

A 50-member Bangladesh contingent is set to take part in the 22nd edition multi-disciplinary extravaganza, scheduled to be held from July 28 to August 8 in England.  The Bangladesh contingent will depart in phases for Birmingham from July 20 to take part in seven disciplines -- athletics, boxing, gymnastics, swimming, weightlifting, wrestling and table tennis -- but the organisers are not expecting much regarding medals. ""The chances of winning medals in Birmingham reduced a bit due to the exclusion of shooting and archery, but we are hopeful that the athletes will deliver their best in the world stage and bring laurels for the nation,"" Bangladesh Olympic Association's secretary general Syed Shahed Reza told reporters at an official press conference at BOA auditorium on Sunday. During the last Games held in Gold Coast, Australia in 2018, Shooter Abdullah Hel Baki and Shakil Ahmed won a silver medal each in their respective events while the rest of the athletes returned home empty handed. ""We have a good possibility to produce better results than the last edition because we have a good sprinter [England-based sprinter Imranur Rahman] who has been doing well.

We are expecting something better in other individual events as gymnast Ali Kader is expected to reach the final eight in his events,"" said BOA vice-president and Bangladesh Gymnastics Federation's president Bashir Ahmed Mamun. Replying to a query, Shahed Reza said, ""50 years into the independence, we don't have any intention to send athletes into Games as token participation, instead we want results. But we lack long-term training and financial ability. I am not disappointed, though, since we have improved in the past eight to 10 years as two of our athletes have qualified for the Olympics directly.""

3072401,French hopes flagging on Tour de 'Lose',17-07-2022,/sports/cycling/news/french-hopes-flagging-tour-de-lose-3072401,sports,"Regional newspaper Le Progres groaned over the long wait for a home Tour de France stage winner this weekend with the scathing headline ""Blue, Blanc, Lose"", a play on the French tri-colour using lose instead of Rouge. The issue has become both a hot topic and a hot potato on an enthralling Tour featuring fans galore, eye-catching panoramas and an epic title struggle after Jonas Vingegaard knocked champion Tadej Pogacar off his perch in an Alpine stage for the ages. Danes and Belgians have won three stages in this pulsating 109th edition of the world's most prestigious bike race, the Dutch, Slovenians and Australians twice -- but France is still sighing with disappointment. Britain's Tom Pidcock and Bob Jungels of Luxembourg won the other stages, but at least the latter races for a French team -- AG2R. The charismatic climber Thibaut Pinot of the FDJ outfit has come closest for France, with a long-range bid Saturday giving him a third place for the second time. ""I'm so disappointed,"" said Pinot, reflecting the general mood of French cycling. ""It takes a little bit of luck, a little bit of legs, a little bit of everything,"" he said. A man who seems to make his own luck, Julian Alaphilippe was described as ""the Darling of France"" as he dashed around in the overall leader's yellow jersey for most of the 2018 Tour. France's double world champion Alaphilippe won a stage on each of the last four Tours, but hit a tree at high speed in the build-up to this one. His swashbuckling win on stage 1 last year is France's last, meaning that if no French rider wins Sunday's run to Carcassonne on stage 15, the wait stretches to 36 stages and counting. Pyrenees provides perfect platform But France may not have to wait too long, with a trilogy of Pyrenean Mountain stages coming up next week and a trident of domestic hopes capable of delivering what French fans often love best, a sudden burst of Gallic flair delivering triumph in the face of adversity. Pinot himself has previously achieved this, sending his emotional team boss Marc Madiot into delirium on the Col du Tourmalet in 2019. ""I'm looking forwards to the Pyrenees, those long climbs are the kind that suit me,"" he said, and his recent win on the Tour de Suisse suggests this is more than bluster. Pinot's younger teammate David Gaudu is also talking up a fight after finding his form on Saturday's final climb accompanied by blockbuster crowds. ""I unleashed the horses and boy did they run. Now I'm in the mood for it and I can't wait to get to the Pyrenees,"" he said. Gaudu is eighth in the overall leaderboard, just 4min 24sec off the lead. Ahead of him is Romain Bardet in fourth breathing down Ineos leader Geraint Thomas's neck. ""Romain seems to be on the form of his life,"" Thomas warned this week warning that Vingegaard and Pogacar have a series of challengers. Bardet himself was more gloomy on the issue. ""It'll have to be an ambush, Vingegaard and Pogacar are superior to the rest of us, there are four of us all fighting for third place,"" he said. Bardet suggested he would sacrifice a potential place on the podium in Paris for a stage win. ""If I get even a glimpse of an opportunity I'll go for it even if it's risky, a stage win remains my top priority,"" said Bardet. France would certainly thank him for it."

She thanked Abu Subhan and ASWT for their efforts. Renowned artist and sculptor Hamiduzzaman Khan attended the event as special guest. He expressed his admiration for Abu Subhan and praised the curator of this successful event, Kanak Chanpa Chakma. Her Excellency Nathalie Chuard, the ambassador of Switzerland in Bangladesh, said, indigenous cultures are important to protect the environment and her homeland always upholds the striving minority groups.

The formal programme concluded with a few cultural performances from the students of Camellia Duncan Foundation School. This was followed by the opening ceremony. The paintings portrayed several aspects of the indigenous communities in Bangladesh -- their livelihoods, culture and their artifacts.

According to reports, Ratnam tested positive for the new coronavirus, and is currently undergoing treatment in a hospital.

3074856,Netflix predicts return to customer growth during 3rd quarter,20-07-2022,/entertainment/tv-film/news/netflix-predicts-return-customer-growth-during-3rd-quarter-3074856,entertainment,"Netflix Inc on Tuesday averted its own worst-case scenario of subscriber losses, posting a nearly 1 million drop from April through June, and predicted it would return to customer growth during the third quarter. Shares, which have fallen roughly 67% this year on concerns about the company's long-term prospects, rose 8% in after-hours trading following the results. Investors took the forecast as a signal that Netflix could still find new subscribers despite a rocky global economy and signs of saturation in its biggest market, the United States and Canada. The world's largest streaming service said it plans to launch its ad-supported option next year. It also warned that the strong dollar was hitting revenue booked from subscribers abroad. The company had said in April it expected to lose 2 million customers in the second quarter, shocking Wall Street and raising concerns that the streaming TV boom had come to an abrupt end. The losses came in at about half that, at 970,000. ""Our excitement is tempered,"" Chief Executive Reed Hastings said in a post-earnings interview posted on YouTube, given that Netflix still lost subscribers. ""But looking forward, streaming is working everywhere. ... We're very bullish on streaming."" Hastings credited new episodes of the science-fiction series ""Stranger Things,"" the most-watched English-language show in Netflix history, with helping to stave off more defections. Netflix forecast customer additions for July through September to hit 1 million, while Wall Street analysts on average were expecting a forecast of 1.84 million, according to analysts polled by Refinitiv. ""The stock is up because (analyst) downgrades all made a big deal out of slowing growth,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said, noting that Netflix was cutting costs and expected free cash flow to grow substantially next year. Shares of other streaming companies rose slightly after the Netflix report. Roku Inc stock gained 2.7% while Walt Disney Co and Paramount Global were each up about 1%. After years of red-hot growth, Netflix's fortunes changed as rivals including Disney, Warner Bros Discovery and Apple Inc invested heavily in their own streaming services. Netflix lost 1.3 million customers in the United States and Canada in the second quarter, and 770,000 in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. That was offset by a gain of nearly 1.1 million members in the Asia/Pacific region. In a letter to shareholders on Tuesday, Netflix said it had further examined the recent slowdown, which it attributed to a variety of factors including password-sharing, competition and a sluggish economy. ""Our challenge and opportunity is to accelerate our revenue and membership growth by continuing to improve our product, content and marketing as we've done for the last 25 years, and to better monetize our big audience,"" the letter said. One way the company plans to earn more from members is by limiting password-sharing. The company is testing two options in Latin America. It also is working to build on the popularity of ""Stranger Things"" and seeking to turn some of its biggest successes into franchises. Netflix remains the dominant streaming service with nearly 221 million global paid subscribers. Co-CEO Ted Sarandos said the company still sees room for ""enormous"" growth by attracting many of the billions of people worldwide who have yet to sign up. ""We have some headwinds right now, and we're navigating through them,"" Sarandos said. For April through June, earnings per share came in at $3.20, ahead of the Wall Street consensus of $2.94. Netflix said the strong US dollar hit revenue, which grew 9% to $7.97 billion, below analyst estimates of $8.04 billion. Revenue would have increased by 13% without the foreign exchange impact, the company said. Last week, Netflix announced Microsoft Corp as its technology and sales partner for the ad-supported offering."

3074356,J-Hope dives into darkness with ‘Jack in the Box’,20-07-2022,/entertainment/music/news/j-hope-dives-darkness-jack-the-box-3074356,entertainment,"J-Hope of BTS fame made his debut as a solo artist with his latest album ""Jack in the Box"". On the album, J-Hope showcased that he was not afraid to embrace the reality of the world, and that he was ready to work his way through any broken path or challenge to reach his goals. The 22-minute long album starts with an introduction track titled ""Intro"", that tells the tale of Pandora's Box. The female narrator for ""Intro"" says, ""It was Hope that was kept in the innermost nook of the box. It trailed behind the miasma of darkness, assuaging the ill effects on humankind. Hope gave people the will to keep on living amidst the pain and strife."" While J-Hope's 2018 mixtape ""Hope World"", was full of colours and shared the artist's gratitude for his life and work, ""Jack in the Box"" is full of darkness. This contrast of light and dark is prevalent throughout the album, with the artist hinting that 'hope' is the only thing helps us survive the darkness of life. Using the sounds of hip-hop, rap-rock, R&B, and grunge, J-Hope was able to shock fans with a new and unique sound that they previously did not associate with the artist. While listening to the first single of this album ""More"", I was stunned because I had never expected to see this version of J-Hope in my dreams, let alone in reality. This album is almost like a storybook, which one needs to approach chronologically, with all 10 tracks acting like 10 chapters of a novel. ""Stop"", followed by ""More"", gave us an idea of the ideals with which J-Hope lives his life, particularly the philosophy that there are no 'bad people' in this world. The artist questions if people are truly black and white, which to him does not make sense. Instead, he feels that people are almost like the different shades of grey, where it is impossible to label them as just good or bad. Eventually, J-Hope asks listeners to stop the judgement and calm down. ""= (Equal Sign)"" is another song with a message, that asks to put a stop to the endless discrimination that we engage in and face ourselves in this world. J-Hope tries to send the message that everyone, irrespective of age, gender, and borders, are equal. By the end of the song, the artist urges people to not fill their hearts and minds with hate, as this will only paralyse them; leaving us with the message that it costs nothing to be kind. The first half of the album tells us the story of Jack, which in this case is J-Hope himself, who is living inside a box, hoping to eventually get out. After the interlude, ""Music Box: Reflection"", it is presumed that Jack has finally escaped from his box, and now is finally able to see that life no longer looks the same as it did from inside. From questioning what would he would be without the success and fame he has now, to thinking about the future, J-Hope bares it all on ""Jack in the Box"". The album ends with the song ""Arson"", saying, ""Do I put out the fire, or burn even brighter?"""

In the mid-1980s, Bhupinder married the Bangladeshi singer Mitali Mukherjee, as his appearances in films became sporadic. He is also survived by his son Nihal Singh, who is also a talented musician."

Recalling their friendship, singer-writer Putul Sajia Sultana took to her Facebook to write an open letter in the memory of her long-lost friend. Her letter read: Dear Abid, Happy birthday. Every year on this day, a sense of regret overwhelms me as I had a lot left to tell you. New stories and memories start to pile up with each passing year. You have a little niece, we have named her Harmony Geetolina. I can only imagine the joy on your face when you would have held her in your arms. I am sure you would have been the first one to arrive with your wife and kids to see her. By now, you would have been the proud father of two beautiful children. You would have mocked my maternal obesity and within just a few minutes, you would have said, ""No worries pal, you will regain your old shape in no time!"" You know, Harmony would have been born a cancer, just like you and I, if she had delayed her birth by just a day. She was born on June 20. Harmony Geetolina—such a nice name, right? Her name is inspired from Rabindranath Tagore's ""Geetabitan"". Explaining the meaning of 'Geetolina' would not have been necessary if you were here, as Tagore always had a special place in your heart. You are doing well, right? Walking along the waves, you decided to find your house in the mild beams of moonlight, leaving us behind. Are you well in your moon-house? Abid passed away on July 29, 2011 at the mere age of 26. The singer drowned in the sea at Cox's Bazar."

The month-long exhibition concludes tomorrow. The artist's singular style occupies time-honoured folk motifs and Bengali ballads. Throughout his entire life and artistic career, Samar Majumder persistently experiments with newer modes of expression - his compositions are natural in essence, as they relate to the soul, soil and the bucolic beauty of Bangladesh. He consciously takes his artistic muse and strength from human feelings and emotions.   Art lovers can easily connect his simplistic forms that engage his ideas in a dialectical exploration of metaphors, nuances and meanings. Yet, at the same time, they depict different expressive modes. Folk art has got a new lease of life, thanks to the dedicated creative efforts by the artist. He continues to experiment with the conventional folk motifs and creates his own works blending those with the touch of modernity.  Following the folk-traditions of Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin, Patua Quamrul Hassan, Safiuddin Ahmed, SM Sultan, Jamini Roy and other master artists, the prominent features in Samar's works include varied connotations of folk elements such as tepa putul, sora, nakshi kantha, design of homemade cake, jar, boat, bird, tree, river, fish, crop, flower, fruit, animal and the life sketches of rural people. Samar Majumder's compositions are bordered with free-flowing thick brush lines set on a thin layered colour background.  His sketches retain only the bare essentials, sometimes employing just a brief line to cover for a whole figure. Yet, they are immensely expressive. Mature hues and a lyrical colour balance are prominent features of his body of works.  Closely observing the lives of village people, artisans, farmers and the nature of rural Bangladesh, the artist has adeptly depicted common characters of pastoral Bangladesh. The 'rakhal' playing flute, fishermen's fishing in the river at night, house in coastal area, mother, angling whole day on a boat, framers' working in the field, village girl with her pet, girl with water lily and the musician are some of his prominent depictions for the ongoing exhibit.   His three-decade long career as an Assistant Chief Designer at BSCIC (Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation) helped him understand and support various artisans. At BSCIC, he also received mentorship from legendary artist Quamrul Hassan. He initially worked with textiles and tapestry, but his work allowed him to travel throughout the country where he got to know the lives of artisans and rural people. Samar Majumdar started painting in his early childhood. Later, he completed his academic studies from the Institute if Fine Arts, University of Dhaka in 1980. For the last four decades, he has been working on book cover designs and illustrations. He also garnered the best cover designer award from National Book Center six times."

The exhibition features multiple series of abstract, objective and non-objective paintings by the artist such as ""Horizon"", ""Memory"", ""Fragment"", ""My Journey"", ""Mindscape"", and ""Before Time"". Initially, the exhibition began on June 18 and is now set to be available at the gallery till July 23. ""Normally whenever we think about the horizon, we look as far as our vision can comprehend,"" said Azmeer Hossain. ""However, I cannot help but wonder what's beyond that. Every painting in this exhibition embodies the horizons of my mind, accumulating over my experience with nature, life, and my imagination."" Every painting in this exhibition expresses a unique sensation through the use of space and dimensions as if to give the viewers an insightful look towards the infinite horizon trapped in the canvas. ""Azmeer sir's work has always been fascinating as they represent so much more than what meets the eye,"" says Sanjida Sultana, a school teacher and passionate artist. ""His efforts and thoughts are apparent in his art. No wonder his paintings take months or even years to complete."" Taking a closer look, viewers may notice the vast multitude of layers used to perfectly portray the space between the subjects in the paintings in such a way so that it seamlessly mirrors reality. ""In our daily life we are living in a city that is filled with diversified textures, noises, forms, colours, sounds and smells,"" said renowned artist Syed Golam Dastagir. ""This chaotic and packed city is where Azmeer was born and brought up, and this has greatly influenced his art."" Watercolour has been a traditional medium in Bangladeshi art, dating from the Pala to Mughal eras. However, this particular type of watercolour was of an opaque quality. Later on, the British era introduced a new type of watercolour that belonged to the British impressionist school, which is transparent in nature. Azmeer Hossain is well known for his mastery over the use of watercolours. ""We are learning a lot about art every day. Yet, I feel the methods we use to create art should be equally researched,"" said the artist. After almost twenty-five years of studying and research, Azmeer Hossain came up with his own unique way of using watercolours. ""Suppose a buffalo stands before a tree. There is an obvious gap between the two subjects in reality, yet watercolour painting methods would not be able to express that gap in the canvas."" ""Over the years, I have developed my own way to remedy these flaws of watercolour,"" mentions Azmeer Hossain. ""This particular way of using watercolour has become my signature style."" ""In the future, I am hoping to spread my knowledge on watercolours to the next generation of artists,"" concluded Azmeer Hossain."

3063766,How Jnanadanandini Devi taught Bengali working women to wear the Sari ,04-07-2022,/entertainment/theatre-arts/news/how-jnanadanandini-devi-taught-bengali-working-women-wear-the-sari-3063766,entertainment,"At the helm of the Bengali Renaissance were the Tagores of Jorasanko, among whom was the bold and independent Jnanadanandini Devi, the bride of Satyendranath Tagore. She was a social reformer whose revolutionary style in sari made her an icon for working women. In the 19th century Bengal, women of the affluent class were seen wearing semi-transparent and light sarees without the use of undergarments. Jnanadanandini was married into the Tagore family which meant that she would be residing in the Tagore Zenana, the inner rooms of the residence reserved for female family members of the household. It was a common cultural product of the Indo-Islamic period and a system of seclusion for married women at the time. However, village women who lived outside of such seclusions had the freedom to wear woven saris, unlike the Zenana sari which was not intended for public wear. These affluent women could only drape winter shawls as an additional garment over their Zenana sharis. Her husband, Satyendranath Tagore, would bring his young wife across India to Bombay to get a taste of the multicultural life in the West. Socialising with European circles including Parsi and European women as well as entering a sphere of English customs became a vision of courage. While socialising with the Parsi and European ladies; a wave of courage and inspiration took over her spirit. She wanted to design a sari which will incorporate the essence of both Parsi and Bengali culture in one. It was a big challenge, but her husband was extremely supportive of her decision. 'If you have to change your mode of dress, please do not hesitate'' said Satyendranath Tagore. She improvised upon the traditional sari, blending her own style with that of Parsi women. She observed the styles of the English blouses, sleeves, ribbons, and brooches. These reiterations gave life to the modern day saree by draping the aanchall over the left shoulder, freeing the right arm. She created frontal pleats and brooches. A blouse and petticoat was also introduced after the influence of Parsi women. The style became to be known as the Thakurbari Sari, an epitome of the modern, educated, and privileged woman. Jnanadanandini went on to train other women to wear the saree in her own style through advertisements in the Bamabodhini Patrika. This introduced a generation of working-class women to show up in public wearing saris - to work, to parties, and to the global arena. Jnanadandini's boldness taught the world that these women could come out of confinement and enter global spheres, carrying the pride of their own history in their attire. It gave saris nationwide acceptability and to women, their mobility. It meant that women, even today, could keep with them an enduring proof of a lasting history of Indo-Western tradition which emerged from a silent but illustrious revolution by the women of the Tagore family. Even though this daring act caused much discord in the household, Jnanadanlini's courage and creativity paved the way to break the customs of the upper caste. These women must never be forgotten for their insurmountable significance in the Bengali Renaissance. Their role went beyond raising an intellectual awakening among the people - it revolutionized the lives of the contemporary in a materialistic way forever. Today, this style is the most popular way to drape a sari and its artistry is embraced by women in all parts of the world."
3076556,Forex crisis spills over to bond market,22-07-2022,/business/economy/news/forex-crisis-spills-over-bond-market-3076556,business,"Banks in Bangladesh are already in a tight liquidity situation since they have to buy US dollars at higher rates to settle import bills.  So, they are not keen to invest in the government's long-term securities and bonds although the investment tools offer much higher rates compared to a year ago. Rather, they are on the lookout for higher returns in order to make the most out of their limited funds. As a result, the government is struggling to raise funds from commercial banks to meet its expenditures by issuing Treasury bills and bonds with yields ranging from 6 per cent to 8.65 per cent. The yield ranged from 0.79 per cent to 6 per cent a year ago. In order to support the government, the central bank itself is investing in the securities in a massive way, a move that may fan inflation, which hit a nine-year high in June owing to the volatility in global commodity markets. Experts warn that banks' capacity to lend to the government will erode in the days to come due to the ongoing instability in the foreign exchange market of Bangladesh. The central bank has lent Tk 7,792 crore to the government so far in July through the purchase of T-bills and bonds. The government has set a bank borrowing target of Tk 106,000 crore for the current fiscal year. But it may overshoot the target owing to weak revenue collection. The government borrowed Tk 72,749 crore from banks last fiscal year in contrast to Tk 24,292 crore the year before. In the last fiscal year that ended on June 30, banks bought a record $7.62 billion of US dollars from the central bank with a view to meeting the demand of importers. This means a large amount of local currency was automatically mopped up, creating liquidity pressure in the banking system. Excess liquidity at banks stood at Tk 189,183 crore in May, down 11 per cent year-on-year. The central bank has injected $808 million into the money market in the first couple of weeks of the current fiscal year to keep the foreign exchange market stable. Bangladesh's international currency reserves fell to $39.67 billion on Wednesday in contrast to $46.15 billion in December, owing to abnormally high imports, which swelled by 39 per cent to $75.40 billion between July and May. Syed Mahbubur Rahman, managing director of Mutual Trust Bank, says the interest rates on the T-bills and bonds have increased significantly in recent months, but they are not good enough to draw banks. This is because many banks have to collect deposits at 7.50 per cent, which makes it difficult for them to invest in long-term T-bonds. The interest rate on the 10-year T-bond is 8.1 per cent. ""Nobody can predict the market behaviour, which is now facing liquidity pressure. Besides, a majority of deposits are short-term with tenures standing at six months and below,"" Rahman said. A BB official, on condition of anonymity, says that some lenders are quoting more than a 9 per cent interest rate at the auction of government securities. Since banks are seeking more than 9 per cent interest rate on government securities, the central bank is now purchasing those bills and bonds to keep the interest rate below 9 per cent, he said. ""The ongoing tight liquidity situation will improve thanks to the BB's investment in the securities,"" said Mirza Elias Uddin Ahmed, managing director of Jamuna Bank.  ""Such investment will create new money in the market."" However, there is a possibility that the BB's investment will leave an adverse impact on inflation. ""So, banks should place an emphasis on disbursing loans to the productive sector in order to offset the prices hike,"" Ahmed said. In Bangladesh, inflation raced to a nine-year high of 7.56 per cent in June. Ahsan H Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh, says that the central bank has recently taken a contractionary monetary policy to tackle inflationary pressure. ""It is now financing the government in a massive way, going against its tight monetary policy. But the central bank should not invest in government securities at this moment as it will stoke inflationary pressure."" According to Mansur, the only way to bring stability to the bond market is to withdraw the lending cap on loans. The central bank has been following a 9-per cent interest rate cap on all loans except credit cards since April 2020. It is now trying to follow the same in the bond market. Mansur also suggested the central bank not inject foreign currencies into the market massively as reserves are squeezing at a faster pace. ""State-run banks, which are now receiving the greenback from the BB to import petroleum and other essential commodities, should manage funds from other banks,"" he said. The former official of the International Monetary Fund thinks ensuring a floating exchange rate of the taka against the US dollar will help make the inter-bank forex platform vibrant as many lenders are showing reluctance to sell dollars using the window. Banks are now imposing much higher rates on importers than what the central bank has asked them to follow, rendering the inter-bank platform almost inoperative. The exchange rate of the taka stood at Tk 94.45 per USD yesterday, down 11.38 per cent year-on-year."
3076551,Trial run of Patenga terminal hits a snag,22-07-2022,/business/economy/news/trial-run-patenga-terminal-hits-snag-3076551,business,"The planned trial berthing of a vessel at the newly built Patenga Container Terminal (PCT) in the Chattogram port could not be begun yesterday due to the non-completion of some works.  The Chittagong Port Authority (CPA) last week announced that it would start the trial operation of the terminal by berthing a bulk vessel in one of the four jetties of the PCT, whose construction began in 2017. Some trial tests such as jetty load test, pile load test and mooring bollard load test for checking the load capacity of various parts of the jetties are yet to be carried out. CPA Chairman Rear Admiral M Shahjahan said some test trials and mechanical works need to be done before berthing a vessel. ""Otherwise, accidents might take place."" Load calibration of the weighbridge to synchronise with the entry and exit points has not been done yet. If the calibration is not completed, the authorities would be not able to perform the required verified gross mass test of container-carrying vehicles. ""We are trying to complete these works in the quickest possible time,"" said Shahjahan, adding that the trial operation might take place by the end of July. The government approved the project to construct the terminal having three container jetties and a dolphin jetty on around 32 acres of land at Patenga in June 2017. According to the initial proposal, the project was supposed to complete by December 2019. The implementation period was extended to June 2022 in the revised proposal. Speaking about the delay, Project Director and CPA Executive Engineer Mizanur Rahman said there were many challenges at the initial stage since 50 per cent area of the site was occupied by many structures of various organisations and they needed to be relocated. Owing to the coronavirus pandemic, the construction remained suspended for several months since foreign workers had left, he said, adding that more than 96 per cent of works have been completed. The original cost was estimated at Tk 1,868 crore and the terminal was supposed to be built by the CPA's funds. In the revised plan, the expenditure was reduced to Tk 1,229 crore as the government decided to execute it under the public-private partnership arrangement where the operator will procure the necessary equipment. The terminal might be formally inaugurated by September. Once the PCT becomes fully operational, the Chattogram port will be able to handle an additional five lakh twenty-foot equivalent units of containers annually. The terminal will also accommodate larger vessels with 10 metres draught. The port currently permits the berthing of vessels with up to 9.5 metres draught."

3076546,Dollar gets even pricier ,22-07-2022,/business/economy/news/dollar-gets-even-pricier-3076546,business,"The taka depreciated once again against the US dollar in the inter-bank platform yesterday.  The exchange rate stood at Tk 94.45 per dollar. It was Tk 93.95 on Wednesday. On July 21 last year, the rate was Tk 84.80, which means there has been a 11.38 per cent loss in value in a year. The country's foreign exchange market is facing a shortage of US dollars due to rising import payments and declining inflows of remittance. Import payments have been going up since the end of last year because of a rise in the prices of commodities in the global market. Between July and May of last fiscal year, import payments went up by 39 per cent year-on-year to $75.40 billion while exports grew 33 per cent to $44.58 billion. This resulted in a record trade deficit -- the gap between exports and imports -- of $30.81 billion, up 48.8 per cent year-on-year. The inflow of remittance, the cheapest source of foreign currencies for Bangladesh, fell 15 per cent year-on-year to $21.03 billion in fiscal year 2021-22. The country's foreign exchange reserves stood at $39.67 billion on Wednesday, in contrast to $46.15 billion in December last year. Bangladesh Bank injected $70 million into the market yesterday to keep the market stable, Md Serajul Islam, spokesperson for the central bank, told The Daily Star. The BB has so far injected $808 million in the market this fiscal year after supplying a record $7.62 billion last fiscal year. Ahsan H Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh, said the central bank should reduce the injection of dollars into the market to shield the reserves from the pitfalls of a declining trend. He said the state-run banks, which were now receiving the greenback from the central bank to import petroleum and other essential commodities, should manage the fund from other banks. Ensuring a floating exchange rate of the taka against the dollar will help turn the platform vibrant as many lenders are showing reluctance to sell dollars using the window, he said. Banks are now charging a much higher rate in selling dollars to importers than what the central bank had asked them to follow, which is why the inter-bank platform has almost become inoperative."

The listed multinational ceramics brand yesterday informed the Dhaka Stock Exchange of its decision, which follows the company's previous plan to enter the tiles market. Early last month, RAK Ceramics announced that it would invest Tk 902 in a greenfield facility to raise its tile production capacity by 15,000 square metres per day. ""As Bangladesh has huge potential in the coming days, we opted to increase production and grab a bigger share of the market,"" said Muhammad Shahidul Islam, company secretary of RAK Ceramics. ""Now, we are going to produce all bathroom fittings. We will soon start building the plant, which may take nearly a year to begin production,"" he added. Islam went on to say that at present, most locally produced bathroom fittings are of low standard but people prefer significantly more expensive high-quality products that are imported. So, RAK Ceramics aims to produce alternatives to these imports so that customers can get quality products at competitive prices."

It shed 240 points over the past eight sessions. The Dhaka stocks witnessed buying pressure in the morning which did not sustain at the end of the day, said International Leasing Securities in its daily market review. The selling spree of risk-averse investors continued focusing sector-specific issues amidst growing macroeconomic worries, it said. Uncertainty is still growing with the deepening of the energy crisis, rising inflation and forex market volatility, it added. Among the sectors, paper rose 1.9 per cent, cement 1 per cent and telecommunication 0.6 per cent whereas ceramics and life insurance dropped by 1.7 per cent and 1.2 per cent respectively. Investors' activities were mainly focused on the textile sector, which accounted for 17.5 per cent of the day's turnover, followed by engineering (10.1 per cent) and pharmaceuticals (8.8 per cent). Turnover, another key indicator of the market, fell to Tk 676 crore, up nearly 2 per cent from that a day ago. Of the securities traded on the day, 115 advanced, 219 fell and 47 remained unchanged. Both DS30, the blue-chip index, and DSES, the Shariah-based index, lost 5 points and 1 point respectively. S Alam Cold Rolled Steels topped the gainers' list, rising 9.90 per cent. Prime Textile Spinning Mills, Bangladesh Industrial Finance Company, New Line Clothings, and Fareast Finance and Investment also rose significantly. Asia Pacific General Insurance Company shed the most, 2 per cent. Eastern Lubricants, National Life Insurance Company, Eastern Cables, and Paper Processing & Packaging were also in the list of those suffering the highest losses. The Sonali Paper and Board Mills became the stock to be traded the most, with shares worth Tk 40 crore changing hands, followed by Robi Axiata, Beximco, KDS Accessories, and the Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company. Chittagong Stock Exchange (CSE) also witnessed erosions yesterday., The Caspi, the all-share price index of the port city bourse, plunged 62 points, or 0.34 per cent, to 17,968.

3076526,Experts for making mobile tower sharing mandatory,22-07-2022,/business/economy/news/experts-making-mobile-tower-sharing-mandatory-3076526,business,"Mobile subscribers are being deprived of quality services as operators remain reluctant to share their tower infrastructure even though relevant policies have been in place for years, according to experts. Network providers are unwilling to share their cell towers, known as base transceiver stations (BTS), mainly due to their drive to stay ahead in the competition, they said. The comments came yesterday at a roundtable, styled ""Challenges in Infrastructure Sharing for the Development of Network"", organised by Telecom Reporters' Network Bangladesh (TRNB) at the BRAC Center Inn in Mohakhali, Dhaka. There are two policies regarding the sharing of network infrastructure -- the Amended Guidelines for Infrastructure Sharing, and Regulatory and Licensing Guidelines for Issuing Licence for Tower Sharing in Bangladesh -- which have been in place since 2011 and 2018 respectively. Discussants at the roundtable said making it mandatory for operators to follow both policies would ensure maximum utilisation of network facilities, opening an opportunity to save huge amounts of electricity at the same time. Besides, the quality of services would be comparatively better, they added. ""Tower sharing among operators has reached just 17 per cent over the last 25 years,"" said TIM Nurul Kabir, a telecom analyst who presented the keynote paper. ""As such, about 20,000 towers owned by operators are still not being shared,"" he added. Currently, Robi Axiata is sharing 30 per cent of its own towers, Grameenphone 18 per cent and Banglalink 17 per cent. Kabir went on to say that tower management requires large amounts of electricity, which puts pressure on the country's fuel supply. ""So, unplanned towers are having long-term effects on the environment,"" he said. Kabir added that tower sharing should not be mandatory in any standard telecommunication system but it is a must in Bangladesh considering the ongoing imbalance in the local telecom market. With this backdrop, Telecom Minister Mustafa Jabbar urged network providers to hand over their towers to BTS operators so that all of them can use these infrastructures, enabling customers to receive higher quality services. ""This would reduce the large investments telecom companies have to make in setting up such infrastructures as well,"" he said. He then advised network operators to improve their service quality unless they want to lose their market share. ""If you can't maintain the quality of service, you will suddenly fall as there is no alternative to increase the service quality,"" he added. Jabbar also said active tower sharing is essential for ensuring smooth digital services as passive sharing does not offer significant benefits in this regard. Shyam Sunder Sikder, chairman of the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC), said they are taking initiatives to speed up tower sharing. ""Mobile network operators should not only focus on expanding their business, they should also ensure better quality of service,"" he added. However, infrastructure sharing is not only limited to cell towers. ""All telecom companies should come forward in sharing their respective infrastructures, such as fibre optic cables, for ensuring optimal service quality,"" said Hossain Sadat, senior director of corporate affairs at Grameenphone. ""Under the BTRC's prudent guidance, we all need to collaborate in accelerating the sharing of our respective infrastructures to help the government realise its vision of a smart Bangladesh,"" he added. ""Grameenphone, being a tech service provider, always welcomes industry consultation towards formulating business friendly frameworks and further enhancing customer experience."" Taimur Rahman, chief corporate and regulatory affairs officer at Banglalink, said tower sharing should be immediately made compulsory for all operators, especially considering the current energy crisis. ""If we can cooperatively share infrastructure, electricity and other energy will be properly utilised,"" Rahman added. Anamika Bhakta, an executive vice president of Robi Axiata, said tower sharing could help ensure faster rolling out of services, benefiting customers greatly in the process. Rashed Mehedi, president of TRNB, and Masuduzzaman Robi, general secretary, also spoke at the event."
3076516,"Regulatory moves target private sector, not public sector",22-07-2022,/business/economy/news/regulatory-moves-target-private-sector-not-public-sector-3076516,business,"Bangladesh Bank has recently taken some serious decisions, the speed and approach of which seem unusual.   Such hard decisions are supposed to come after intense negotiations among the top business organisations, the industries, commerce and finance ministries, and the Bangladesh Bank. It's surprising that decisions are suddenly made without involving the stakeholders in the negotiations. Apparently, the BB has taken major decisions to discourage imports except for food, fuel, and raw materials, the impact of which is far-reaching. If the necessary import economy too is discouraged in this way, the dollar will be saved for sure. But will export be saved too? Our exports depend on imports! And how to save the employment and the economy as a whole? Some of the decisions taken together to solve the dollar crisis are: a reduction in banks' dollar holding limit; the obligation to monetise 50 per cent of US dollars held in the Exporter's Retention Quota (ERQ) accounts; and the reduction of deposit limit as ERQ to half, halving of the deposit limit of realised export proceeds. The restrictions on the transfer of foreign currency funds from offshore to domestic banking units and transfer terms have been relaxed. An order to inform the central bank 24 hours before opening any private import letter of credit (LC) worth more than $5 million has been issued. In addition, there is a reporting obligation for transactions of $5 million or more. Earlier banks could reserve 20 per cent of their operational capital in foreign currency. The limit is now 15 per cent. However, this will lead to a shortage of funds in foreign currencies for importers. The purpose of extending the ERQ status was to save exporters' required dollars for the next imports, meet sudden needs and make payments hassle-free and fast. In this, exporters could save themselves from multi-stage currency conversion loss. If businessmen need money suddenly, they have to take permission from the Bangladesh Bank to meet all those liabilities. Simply put, the Bangladesh Bank's decision has made export-import a bit more difficult. Moreover, reducing the net open position (NOP) limit of commercial banks to 15 per cent will add another $569 million to the market but it will reduce the capacity of banks to provide LC service. The regulatory agency, on July 18, suspended the issuance of bonds worth about $2.5 million of five institutions. In the history of the central bank, there was no such incidence of withholding valid loan documents. Due to the fuel price hikes in the spot market, the government has reduced the import of fuel oil. Planned electricity load-shedding has started across the country by reducing the supply of gas and oil in the power sector. The government has a maximum fuel oil reserve of 40 days. This is a sign of an extended fuel crisis. The government has decided to stop diesel-based power generation of 1,125 megawatts for the time being. The burden of 'unjust' capacity charges from idle power plants has also increased. It was Tk 21,600 crore in the last financial year. The non-producing rental power plants are claiming $1.5 billion more! The government is going to take unexpected decisions like closing petrol pumps once a week, shutting shops after eight o'clock in the evening, enforcing compulsory load-shedding for 1-2 hours a day, and reducing office hours by 1-2 hours. In the private sector, which accounts for 89 per cent of the formal labour market, the government's contractionary policies have reached a peak. However, the government's own imports and public administration expenditure did not experience a major contraction. There is no initiative to stop unnecessary 'development' projects. There was no direct announcement of cancelling the contract of inefficient rental and quick rental power plants that produce less electricity by burning more fuel. Even in the electricity-fuel crisis, there is no new understanding of green power generation strategy. There is not enough 'fuel diplomacy' with OPEC's major oil and gas producers instead of a commission-friendly spot market for continuous and sustainable fuel supply. It is surprising to know that a 14-year-old government lacks so much in primary energy diplomacy. It does not have any large-scale constant fuel supply agreements with OPEC countries.  There is no implementation of available reform proposals to increase the country's gas production and offshore exploration. There is no effective initiative to discover new labour markets or means of remittance income by sending workers abroad at a lower cost. In other words, although contraction has been imposed in the private sector, there is not enough initiative to reduce the 'dollar expenditure' in the public sector. Some of Bangladesh Bank's initiatives as part of the monitoring framework are certainly useful. But the political integrity of regulatory audit of under-invoicing in exports, over-invoicing in imports, and monitoring of the number of dollars kept in Nostro accounts of private banks are missing. That is, rather than a direct effort to save the dollar, the government's efforts are inadequate and, in some cases, indirect. Discouraging the opening of LCs via several active and passive measures will have a profound impact on the economy. The obligation to open LCs at a 100 per cent margin means blocking the flow of trade capital, affecting both import and export trade. The price of goods will rise again. Much-needed imports too will be blocked, and industrial production will be disrupted. This will further increase inflation, reduce export earnings and will lead to layoffs and more misery in public life. Aberrant monetary policy in favour of 'cheap money and credit', running single-digit interest despite double-digit inflation, loaning more than the NBR and non-NBR revenue can sustain increased expenditure of public administration, unfair selling of government bonds to Bangladesh Bank, reckless money supply, mismanagement in the banking sector, policy in favour of black money, reducing collateral numbers in bank lending, and giving incredible opportunities to defaulters were all political decisions. It was the process of creating new riches and profit-centred 'development' policies. Due regulation was completely absent.   Now in crisis, we are seeing the severity of the regulatory decisions, yet the government is unable to take political decisions to reset the energy security policy. Good governance, accountability and transparency should also be the focus.  Foreign currency reserves are now $39.7 billion, according to the government, but $32.5 billion, according to the International Monetary Fund. But some sources claim that the EDF, non-investment grade bonds, reserve loans given to various government banks, development projects, loans given to Sri Lanka and Sudan etc are in the reserve accounts, but not in hand and not usable. At this point in time, expendable reserves are incredibly low. The massive waiver of interest rate to defaulters (4 per cent instead of 10 per cent) will not work and it never worked before. If the exporters have smuggled or laundered a part of the EDF loans, it should be audited properly by LC audit and the prime minister herself should take initiative to bring back the funds. The Bangladesh Bank policy will not work here because many of those loans were politically motivated. The author is a sustainable development critic. He can be reached at faiz.taiyeb@gmail.com"
3076501,Russian gas flow lifts euro,22-07-2022,/business/global-economy/europe/news/russian-gas-flow-lifts-euro-3076501,business,"Stock markets eased on Thursday as a resumption of Russian gas supplies to Europe lifted the euro ahead of the European Central Bank's anticipated first interest rate hike in over a decade to quell inflation. The flow of Russian gas resumed to Germany after a 10-day outage to ease Europe's supply concerns for now, helping to ease worries about fallout on the economy. The euro edged up, distancing itself further from last week's parity against the greenback, the recovery bolstered by expectations the ECB might deliver a big 50 basis-point rate hike. Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that supplies could be reduced further or even stop, prompting the EU to tells its members to cut usage. ""European markets are going to be pulled and pushed by Putin's mood,"" said Michael Hewson, chief markets strategist at CMC Markets. Markets are looking to see how much the ECB will raise interest rates later at 1215 GMT on Thursday, with a 25-bps hike already price in, Hewson said. Traders also await details of an ECB tool to contain stress in bond markets, made all the more urgent by a crumbling government in Italy, one of the euro zone's most indebted countries. Rate hikes from the US Federal Reserve next week and from the Bank of England in August are also well anticipated by now, Hewson said. The STOXX index of 600 European companies was off 0.4 per cent. The MSCI All-Country stock index eased 0.14 per cent. Italian bonds sold off sharply following the collapse of Mario Draghi's government in the euro area's third biggest economy. Nadege Dufosse, head of cross-asset strategy at Candriam, said political turmoil in Italy is putting more pressure on the ECB to have its so-called anti-fragmentation tool in place to cap bond yields and reassure markets. ""I think they will have to deliver on that point, I think it's the main risk today. It must convince investors that it will be efficient,"" Dufosse said. After the latest series of rate hikes, investors will be trying to gauge whether the economy is headed for a soft or hard landing as higher borrowing costs are absorbed, she said. ""It's the expectations for the fourth quarter or next year that can really determine the trend in the market. For now we do not have the answer and we just have to be very pragmatic,"" Dufosse said. Bucking the trend, the Bank of Japan left monetary policy unchanged on Thursday, as expected, and raised its inflation forecasts a little bit. The yen held steady at 138.37 per dollar. Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.25 per cent and S&P 500 futures fell 0.2 per cent. Earnings from Blackstone, Dow Chemical, Philip Morris International, Twitter and American Airlines were due on Thursday. Wall Street indexes rallied overnight but even better-than-expected results from Tesla after hours couldn't carry the positive mood into the Asia session. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.1 per cent and Japan's Nikkei gained 0.4 per cent. A cloud over Chinese growth due to its strict Covid-19 controls and fresh concern over the ailing property market is also casting gloom over the prospects for global demand. Growth-sensitive commodities such as copper and iron ore have been sliding and this week Chinese banks and property stocks have been hurt by borrowers boycotting mortgage payments on unfinished homes. ""Past due mortgages doubled over the week, and ... potential home buyers are waiting for a general drop in home prices for the housing market, including completed projects,"" ING analysts said in a note to clients on Thursday. ""This is negative even for cash-rich developers.""  China's yuan was slightly firmer at 6.7664 to the dollar. Against other currencies the greenback steadied after dipping earlier in the week. The Australian dollar bought $0.68650. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield held at 3.0415 per cent, below the 2-year yield of 3.2359 per cent, a market signal that often presages a recession. Oil prices fell for a second straight session, as demand concerns outweighed tight global supply after US government data showed tepid gasoline consumption during the peak summer driving season. Brent crude was down 2.25 per cent at $104.50 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate dropped 2.6 per cent to $97.32 a barrel."
3076491,ADB slashes Asia growth forecast,22-07-2022,/business/economy/banks/news/adb-slashes-asia-growth-forecast-3076491,business,"The Asian Development Bank on Thursday slashed its 2022 growth forecast for developing Asia and warned economic conditions could worsen, as the war in Ukraine and supply chain disruptions drive up prices. While the impact of Covid-19 had eased, the region was now grappling with the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, lockdowns in China and aggressive interest rate hikes, the Philippines-based bank said. To reflect the deterioration across developing Asia -- which stretches from the Cook Islands in the Pacific to Kazakhstan in Central Asia -- the bank cut its 2022 growth forecast to 4.6 per cent. That compares with its previous prediction in April of 5.2 per cent and the 6.9 per cent growth chalked up last year. It also increased its inflation forecast for the region this year to 4.2 per cent, from 3.7 per cent, due to surging food and fuel prices. Risks to the outlook  ""remain elevated"", the bank warned. ""A substantial slowdown in global growth could hurt exports, manufacturing activity and employment prospects, and cause turbulence in financial markets,"" it said. Double-digit inflation has hit most of the Caucasus and Central Asia -- which have close trade and financial ties to Russia -- as well as Mongolia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Laos and Myanmar. India's inflation was above target at seven percent, but in the rest of the region's large economies it was  ""manageable"". But the bank warned:  ""A worsening fallout from the war in Ukraine could lead to a further surge in global energy and commodity prices, with likely knock-on effects on growth and inflation in developing Asia."" Adding to the region's woes was the strengthening US dollar, seen as a safe haven during periods of uncertainty, which the bank said was weighing on regional currencies and stock markets. ""With financial conditions tightening, growth in advanced economies is softening,"" the bank said. ""And with activity in the PRC (China) hampered by supply chain disruptions, domestic demand and exports in developing Asia are set to face significant challenges."" The growth forecast for East Asia, which includes China, was cut to 3.8 per cent from 4.7 per cent, as Covid-19 lockdowns batter the world's second-biggest economy. In South Asia, where bankrupt Sri Lanka is reeling from its worst economic crisis, the bank lowered its growth forecast to 6.5 per cent from 7.0 per cent previously. But the bank revised up its forecast for the Pacific to 4.7 per cent, from 3.9 per cent, on a surprising rebound in tourism in Fiji."
3076206,Largest loan from IMF on the cards,22-07-2022,/business/economy/news/imf-anticipating-loan-request-3076206,business,"The International Monetary Fund is expecting a formal request for a loan from Bangladesh soon to provide a buffer to the delicate foreign currency reserves amid global economic volatility even though the government remains in two minds about it. ""The authorities are expected to send a request letter to start the programme negotiation,"" said the visiting IMF mission in its concluding remarks yesterday after wrapping up its nine-day tour. The finance ministry is now awaiting the green light from the highest authority to formally approach the IMF for the loan, The Daily Star has learnt from officials involved with the proceedings. The loan amount that would be sought will be decided then, said a finance ministry official on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. Bangladesh can take up to $7 billion from the IMF as per its special drawing rights allocation, but the government would be seeking $4.5 billion. The $987 million loan taken in 2012 under the three-year Extended Credit Facility programme is the largest amount taken from the Washington-based multilateral lender as of now. Loans from the IMF typically come with tough reform plans, which often end up being too exacting to implement for many countries. The conditions that Bangladesh would be subjected to can be gauged from the mission's concluding statement. According to documents seen by The Daily Star, implementing a fuel pricing mechanism, removing the interest rate caps on lending and borrowing, resetting the methodology to report on foreign currency reserves, increasing revenue base, and strengthening corporate governance in the banking sector top the recommendations made by the mission. ""Elevated global commodity prices, growth slowdown in major trading partners and normalisation of remittance inflows suggest that the balance of payments will be under pressure in the coming years, with net reserves declining further,"" the mission said. As of July 13, Bangladesh's foreign currency reserves stood at $39.8 billion, enough to cover just about five months' import bills. In times of economic uncertainty, an import cover of 8-9 months is prescribed by multilateral lenders. The IMF is in disagreement with the Bangladesh Bank's method of calculating foreign exchange reserves, which include the riskier local investment exposure. ""Going forward, the current account balance and the exchange rate will be assessed using the External Balance Assessment methodology,"" it said, adding that an outreach mission will be planned. Given the heightened uncertainty stemming from the war in Ukraine and volatile energy, food and fertiliser prices, it would be prudent to safeguard and rebuild reserves as a buffer against shocks. The mission called for withdrawing the interest rate ceilings of 6 percent and 9 percent for deposits and loans respectively, which would help control inflation and also ease the pressure on reserves. In June, inflation hit a nine-year high of 7.56 percent. Reprioritisation of expenditures, which is much needed given the high subsidy expenditure and weak revenue collection, would also ease the pressure. Subsequently, the mission called for gradually adopting a fuel pricing mechanism in line with the global prices to bring down the subsidy expenditure on energy. This will also help accommodate additional social spending in the form of targeted aid to protect the poor. ""In the absence of adequate revenue mobilisation, budget financing is increasingly relying on costly domestic debt, eroding fiscal space."" The mission recommended reforming the expensive National Savings Certificate programme by separating it from direct budget financing. To increase revenue, which remains among the lowest in the world, a multi-pronged strategy -- including simplifying the value-added tax rate structure, modernising revenue administration and building compliance risk management capacity focusing particularly on large taxpayers -- is needed, the mission said. ""These recommendations are very pertinent to the problems facing Bangladesh at present. Regardless of where it came, these must be followed,"" said Zahid Hussain, a former lead economist of the World Bank's Dhaka office. Recommendations such as reforms in revenue policy and administration and removing the interest rate caps are international best practices, said Ahsan H Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh. ""Why does the government administer the petroleum price? Nowhere in the world would you find this. The price should follow the ebb and flow of the global market."" The interest rate cap should have never been imposed, said Mansur, also the chairman of Brac Bank. ""Nowhere in the world would you find this. Now is crunch time. Inflation is high, so the interest rates have been hiked everywhere. But in Bangladesh that scope is not there because of the interest rate cap. Is this approach reasonable and sound?"" A big portion of the imports is liquefied natural gas, petrol and fertilisers, according to Mansur, a former economist of the IMF. ""If their prices are not hiked, how would their demand go down? This is a policy failure. The government is rationing the use of electricity but where is the savings? People are using generators and charger lights and fans. Only by raising the price do you get savings. If you follow such policies, you will only face misfortune."""

The EPS was Tk 3.63 in the negative as well in the first half of 2022 versus Tk 11.79 reported in the January-June period of 2021. The EPS declined mainly for the higher cost of raw materials and shipping charges, the depreciation of the taka and the scheduled plant repairs and maintenance costs, said the multinational company in a filing on the Dhaka Stock Exchange yesterday.  Per share net operating cash flows, also known as NOCFPS, were Tk 5.34 in the negative in the January-June period compared to Tk 5.73 in the identical period last year. The NOCFPS decreased due to lower sales and lower collection from customers and increased payments to suppliers for the higher raw materials prices, said the company.

3076481,Gas crisis to cost 1.5pc of German economy: IMF,22-07-2022,/business/global-economy/news/gas-crisis-cost-15pc-german-economy-imf-3076481,business,"Halting Russian gas supplies to Germany would cost Europe's largest economy 1.5 per cent of its GDP in 2022, the International Monetary Fund said Wednesday, as concerns mount that Moscow will further squeeze supply. This year's loss would be followed by a negative impact of 2.7 per cent in 2023 and a 0.4-per cent reduction in 2024, according to an IMF forecast where gas deliveries were assumed to have stopped on June 1. A potential shutoff  ""could cause sizable reductions in German economic activity and increases in inflation"", the IMF said in a statement. Supplies to Germany from Russia are currently at zero as the Nord Stream pipeline undergoes maintenance, after Moscow initially slashed deliveries by 60 per cent in mid-June citing a delayed gas turbine repair. Berlin has rejected Gazprom's turbine explanation and believes Russia is squeezing supplies in retaliation for Western sanctions on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. Works on the pipeline are due to finish Thursday, with officials watching closely to see if and at what levels supplies resume. The risks for the economy from a complete shutdown, as well as a weak global economy and widespread supply bottlenecks  ""loom large"", the IMF said. The same headwinds meant that German  ""growth is likely to be muted in the coming quarters"", it said. In its standard forecast, the IMF sees the German economy growing by 1.2 per cent in 2022 and just 0.8 per cent in 2023. Meanwhile, the rising price of energy associated with the gas supply reductions already seen also meant that inflation is  ""likely to remain elevated in the next two years"", the IMF said. The IMF forecast inflation in Germany to sit at 7.7 per cent in 2022 and 4.8 per cent in 2023."
3076441,Ukraine pushes for debt freeze to dodge default,22-07-2022,/business/global-economy/europe/news/ukraine-pushes-debt-freeze-dodge-default-3076441,business,"Ukraine has asked its creditors for a two-year payment freeze on its international bonds in a bid to focus its dwindling financial resources on repelling Russia. Creditors have until Aug. 9 to vote on the proposal. Ukraine has called its plan a liability management exercise, indicating Kyiv's efforts to spare bondholders a writedown on the bonds. Official creditors have already said they would suspend payments owed to them and urged bondholders to accept the country's request for the freeze. The group, including Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States, said they would provide a coordinated suspension of debt servicing from August 1 to the end of 2023 and potentially for an additional year. At the end of 2020, Ukraine had $130 billion in external debt outstanding, according to World Bank data. Ukraine has earmarked nearly $20 billion in international bonds to be subject to the debt freeze - eleven dollar-denominated securities and two euro-denominated ones - maturing 2022 to 2030. Ukraine also has a warrant linked to GDP growth in the mix for an overhaul. This was created during its 2015 debt restructuring as a sweetener to creditors."
3076436,Asian cenbanks forced to play catch-up in raising rates,22-07-2022,/business/global-economy/news/asian-cenbanks-forced-play-catch-raising-rates-3076436,business,"Having bucked a global dash to tighten monetary policy for a year, Asian central banks find themselves scrambling to catch up in order to tackle rising inflation and defend weakening currencies. Market analysts suspect Indonesia, the last remaining dove in emerging Asia, may be the next to move by pushing interest rates higher on Thursday, as policymakers rush to convince investors they are tackling rising prices. Singapore and the Philippines surprised markets with unscheduled tightening announcements last week, underlining the growing urgency among policymakers to act. Asia has lagged as the rest of the world, including emerging markets, began lifting rates as early as last June, after the US Federal Reserve kicked off an accelerated timeline for its policy tightening. While relatively subdued inflation allowed central banks in Asia to remain dovish in a bid to support the post-pandemic economic recovery, that led to weakening currencies and capital outflows, even as the war in Ukraine exacerbated price pressures globally. ""Have central banks been too slow to act? Yes, I know, it's a common question,"" Ravi Menon, managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, said at a conference on Tuesday. ""And I don't want to sound defensive on behalf of my colleagues elsewhere but very few people saw this coming. The markets didn't see it. ""The climb in inflation has been quite rapid. It was unusually fast ... And many thought the bigger risks were on the downside on growth and so did not see this coming."" Currencies and bonds have borne the brunt. Among the worst hit, the Philippine peso is down more than 10 per cent year-to-date, and just off a nearly 17-year low of 56.53 per dollar. Yields on the country's government bonds have spiked about 200 basis points (bps) since the start of the year. The Thai baht has fallen more than 10 per cent this year, and Thailand snapped a five-month streak of foreign investment into equities to lose $816 million in June. A large part of the selling has been a response to rising Treasury yields and the US dollar - factors beyond domestic policymakers' control, giving Asia an excuse to hold off on rate hikes. But central banks are suddenly finding they can no longer ignore rising food and oil prices. Thailand and Indonesia saw inflation hit multi-year highs this month. Even South Korea, which began raising rates as early as August 2021, saw prices hit a 24-year high in June, triggering a record half-point rate hike last week. ""What I suspect they're doing at this stage is really (to) still focus on fighting inflation for the next few months, because that's where the concern is,"" said Euben Paracuelles, chief ASEAN economist at Nomura. He added that rising global headwinds and the risk of recession in major economies complicated the policy challenge at a time when inflation was at the start of a sharp pickup in Southeast Asia. India, which first saw its central bank raising rates by 40 bps in an off-cycle move in May, has logged six straight months of foreign investor equity outflows, contributing to a record drop in the rupee. The historically volatile Indonesian rupiah is actually only down around 5 per cent versus the dollar for the year, although it saw its largest monthly fall of 2.2 per cent in June. It has to some extent been helped by resource-rich Indonesia's improved trade position and the fact foreigners now hold less than a fifth of its high-yielding bonds."

3075536,Russia is China’s top oil supplier for 2nd month,21-07-2022,/business/global-economy/europe/news/russia-chinas-top-oil-supplier-2nd-month-3075536,business,"Russia held its spot as China's top oil supplier for a second month in June as Chinese buyers cashed in on lower-priced supplies, slashing more costly shipments from Saudi Arabia, data showed on Wednesday. Imports of Russian oil, including supplies pumped via the East Siberia Pacific Ocean pipeline and seaborne shipments from Russia's European and Far Eastern ports, totalled 7.29 million tonnes, up nearly 10 per cent from a year ago, according to data from the Chinese General Administration of Customs. Still, Russian supplies in June, equivalent to about 1.77 million barrels per day (bpd), were below May's record of close to 2 million bpd, a level analysts had expected to be maintained. China imported 5.06 million tonnes from Saudi Arabia, or 1.23 million bpd, down from 1.84 million bpd in May and 30 per cent below the level in June last year. Year-to-date imports from Russia totalled 41.3 million tonnes (1.67 million bpd), up 4 per cent on the year but still trailing behind Saudi Arabia, which supplied 43.3 million tonnes (1.75 million bpd), a volume 1 per cent below year-ago level. China's total crude oil imports sank in June to near a four-year low as rigid lockdowns to contain the spread of coronavirus reduced fuel demand. The rise in imports from Russia also displaced supplies from Angola and Brazil. The Customs data showed China imported 260,000 tonnes of Iranian crude oil last month, its fourth shipment of Iran oil since last December, confirming an earlier Reuters report. Despite US sanctions on Iran, China has kept taking Iranian oil, usually passed off as supplies from other countries. These supplies, roughly 7 per cent of China's total crude oil imports, are facing competition from the growing Russian flows. Customs reported zero imports from Venezuela."
3075531,UK inflation hits 40- year high,21-07-2022,/business/global-economy/europe/news/uk-inflation-hits-40-year-high-3075531,business,"Surging petrol and food prices last month pushed British inflation to its highest rate in 40 years, according to official figures that bolstered the chances of a rare half percentage-point Bank of England interest rate hike next month. The Office for National Statistics said annual consumer price inflation rose in June to 9.4 per cent, the highest since February 1982, up from May's 9.1 per cent and above the 9.3 per cent consensus in a Reuters poll of economists. The latest increase means Britain had the highest rate of inflation seen in any Group of Seven advanced economy since 1985, although many smaller European Union countries are currently seeing even faster growth in prices. Wednesday's data bolstered bets that the BoE will opt for a 50-bps rate hike next month, which would be the biggest since 1995. The European Central Bank is considering such a move this week, sources told Reuters on Tuesday. BoE Governor Andrew Bailey on Tuesday said that scale of borrowing costs increase was on the table but not ""locked in"". The BoE has raised rates five times since December as it tries to stop the surge in inflation from becoming embedded in Britain's economy, and it is expected to increase them again on August 4. ""Soaring inflation means that momentum for a half-point interest rate rise in August is growing,"" Suren Thiru, economics director of accountancy trade body ICAEW, said. ""However, tightening monetary policy too aggressively increases the risk of recession and will do little to address the global factors driving this inflationary surge."" Investors now see an almost 100 per cent chance of the BoE raising the Bank Rate to 1.75 per cent from 1.25 per cent next month. It said in June that it was ready to act ""forcefully"" if needed. The ONS said core inflation in June fell to 5.8 per cent from 5.9 per cent in May, in line with the Reuters poll median forecast, which could reassure BoE rate-setters who might be reluctant to hike rates more aggressively. The ONS pointed to a 42 per cent year-on-year rise in petrol prices and an almost 10 per cent increase in food prices as the main drivers of inflation last month, a hammer blow for families on low incomes. The Resolution Foundation think-tank said inflation for this group had already passed into double digits. The cost-of-living crunch has triggered a wave of industrial action by trade unions and been hotly debated among the three remaining candidates in the race to replace Boris Johnson as prime minister. Two are promising immediate tax cuts, something the other contender, former finance minister Rishi Sunak, says risks fuelling inflation. There were signs of further inflation pressure ahead in Wednesday's figures. Prices paid by factories for materials and energy - a key determinant of prices later paid by consumers in shops - were 24.0 per cent higher in June than a year earlier, the biggest increase since these records began in 1985, the ONS said. Prices charged by factories jumped 16.5 per cent, the most since September 1977. In response to the data, finance minister Nadhim Zahawi said Britain was not alone in facing runaway inflation and the government was joining forces with the BoE to tackle the problem."

The Dutchman also said that he is still in the market for new players and needs ""more options"", with United chasing Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong. Ten Hag has stamped his mark on United during the pre-season tour of Asia and Australia, but kept Maguire as captain despite the England centre-back struggling last year and being booed by fans. The jeering has followed the 29-year-old to Australia, where Maguire was targeted by a smattering of fans in their 3-1 victory over Crystal Palace in Melbourne. ""We heard,"" Ten Hag told reporters in Perth ahead of United's friendly against Aston Villa on Saturday. ""But you see, if you perform, it slows down. It's about how can we change it. ""The team and Harry can by performing, and that is the only focus."" United have impressed in their first games under disciplinarian Ten Hag with convincing friendly victories over Liverpool, Melbourne Victory and Palace. Their attacking play, hallmarks of Ajax during Ten Hag's reign, has led to renewed confidence ahead of the new Premier League season following their disappointing sixth-placed finish last season. The Red Devils appear set to start the campaign without Cristiano Ronaldo, who hasn't reported back for pre-season after asking to leave Old Trafford. He is missing the tour due to ""a family issue"". ""Of course. But concerning is maybe not the right word,"" Ten Hag said when asked if he was concerned about Ronaldo's absence. ""I focus on the players who are there, they are doing really well, they are in good shape. ""I prefer to focus on that and develop that. I cannot wait for him to come in, then we will integrate him."" As the Ronaldo drama plays out in the background, United are intent on strengthening their squad before the transfer window closes on September 1. United have signed left-back Tyrell Malacia, centre-back Lisandro Martinez and playmaker Christian Eriksen but appear in need of a central midfielder and forward. ""We signed Eriksen for the midfield department, so we are really happy with that,"" Ten Hag said. ""We need more options where you have a good team, and it's not only about the team, you need a good squad to get the right results at the end of the season.

However, when asked, team director Khaled Mahmud Sujon informed that Sohan has been made T20I skipper only for this series.  Meanwhile, pacer Hasan Mahmud, following a long layoff due to injury, has been included in the ODI squad while uncapped Parvez Hossain Emon has been included in the T20I squad for the tour.   Bangladesh squads for the Zimbabwe series: T20I squad: Munim Shahriar, Anamul Haque Bijoy, Liton Das, Afif Hossain, Nurul Hasan Sohan (Captain), Mahedi Hasan, Nasum Ahmed, Taskin Ahmed, Shoriful Islam, Mustafizur Rahman, Mosaddek Hossain, Najmul Hossain Shanto, Mehedi Hasan Miraz, Parvez Hossain Emon.  ODI squad: Tamim Iqbal (Captain), Liton Das, Anamul Haque Bijoy, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mahmudullah Riyad, Afif Hossain, Nurul Hasan Sohan, Mehedi Hasan Miraz, Nasum Ahmed, Taskin Ahmed, Shoriul Islam, Mustafizur Rahman, Hasan Mahmud, Najmul Hossain Shanto, Mosaddek Hossain, Taijul Islam."

The Catalan giants had already sold 10 percent of their league TV rights to the same group last week for 207.5 million euros ($215 million). ""In total, Sixth Street will receive 25 percent of the La Liga club's television rights for the next 25 years,"" Barca said in a statement. The club did not say how much they had been paid for the extra 15 percent, but Spanish press reports put the amount at around 400 million euros. The agreement will help the five-time European champions continue to make new signings for next season after the arrivals of Robert Lewandowski and Raphinha. Barcelona have been desperately trying to raise capital after struggling financially in recent years. Last August, Joan Laporta, who returned as Barcelona president the previous November, said an audit had uncovered total club debts of 1.35 billion euros. The club let Lionel Messi leave last June, saying they could not afford to keep him even at a reduced salary."

""Politics is not a conversation I enjoy.""Ganga Senavirathne, 19-year-old swimmer from Sri Lanka.
Local sports federations have been bled dry by Sri Lanka's financial crash, leaving athletes in doubt in recent weeks over whether they would be able to compete at all.



""Sport has been our lives, it would have been a big, big disappointment,"" said Karunaratne, a three-time Olympian who has appeared at every Commonwealth Games since his debut as a teenager at Manchester in 2002.

""Fortunately the sports ministry and the national cricket board did a great, great job to somehow find the funds,"" the 37-year-old told AFP.
Sri Lanka has weathered months of food and fuel shortages, blackouts and runaway inflation in the wake of its worst financial crash on record.



Public anger over the downturn this month saw a huge crowd storm the home and office of the country's president, who then fled abroad and resigned.
Sports federations were hit hard by the crisis after already seeing their coffers drained during the coronavirus pandemic, which obliterated athletic sponsorships from local businesses.
Federations were left without enough cash to pay for athlete uniforms and plane tickets at a time when a post-pandemic travel bounce has driven up the cost of airfares.
Dampath Fernando, the Sri Lankan team's chef de mission, said administrators had lobbied for support in their determination to do everything they could to give the country a chance to compete.
""As a matter of principle sport brings so many good things, so much happiness,"" Fernando told AFP.
""We want to stand like other nations, in front of our flag, as a proud nation, keeping our backs straight, our heads strong and we want to do our best.""
Commonwealth Games organisers were made aware of the Sri Lankans' financial struggles and responded with a promise to sponsor the bulk of the travelling squad.
Sri Lanka's cricket board, which recently hosted Australia despite fears political unrest would disrupt their seven-week tour of the island, chipped in more than 22 million rupees ($60,000) to help cover the remaining shortfall.
'We have a responsibility' 
Sri Lanka's worsening economy has thrown up other obstacles for the country's athletes and their determination to improve on their haul of one silver and five bronze medals at the Gold Coast in 2018.
Fuel shortages have made it difficult for some competitors to travel to practice, while budget constraints have left sport federations short of clothing and other essential equipment.
Fernando said the resilience of the athletes had made him and his colleagues determined to get the competitors to the Games, which start next Thursday.
""This is not the first time that we as a country have faced these type of battles,"" Fernando said, citing a decades-long civil war and a tsunami that killed more than 30,000 of his compatriots.
""It's a dream of athletes to take part,"" he added. ""We have a responsibility to fulfil that dream. Just because we are facing economic crisis... does not mean that we just forget about it.""
Disruptions and unrest are now part of daily life in Sri Lanka and many athletes have done their best to make do.
""Anyway, I can't control it,"" said Ganga Senavirathne, 19, a swimmer preparing for her Commonwealth Games debut.
""In terms of things I can control, like my training, I was able to manage everything pretty well,"" she told AFP.

And longer format obviously [with] Test cricket."" Pakistan great Wasim Akram 
Legendary Pakistan pacer Wasim Akram was in favour of scrapping the ODI format as Test and T20 cricket gain more ground across the world, fueling the flames of the ODI format's uncertain future that came to the fore when England's Ben Stokes recently chose to retire from the 50-over game. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. 
While ODIs are the Tigers' favoured format, Bangladesh's performances and results in the other two formats have failed to inspire.
""T20 is kind of easier. Four hours, the game is over. Leagues all around the world, there is a lot more money -- I suppose this is part and parcel of the modern cricket. T20 or Test cricket. One-day cricket kind of dying,"" Akram said during a talk with The Telegraph.



If ODIs are losing their allure, sooner rather than later, cricket organisers will have to decide whether ODIs remain relevant. What should Bangladesh do in such a scenario? Talking to The Daily Star yesterday, Nazmul Abedeen Fahim, a mentor to many of the national team stars, felt that Bangladesh would eventually have to focus on the other formats when ODIs become obsolete.
""Test cricket very competitive at the moment. The longest format was able to overcome the arguments that it was not an exciting format. However, due to T20Is, the ODI format may suffer. The general populace will be more intrigued by T20s,"" Fahim said.
""Many say that we won't be able to play T20I cricket due to a lack of power or other things. I don't believe that at all. I think we haven't tried anything except in ODIs in the truest sense. When we will be cornered, we will find a way. When ODIs start to fade, we will focus more on either T20s or Tests. I believe our standards will increase when we start considering T20s seriously.""



Bangladesh do not have much time left to gear up for the upcoming T20 World Cup in Australia. BCB president Nazmul Hassan Papon had said during a recent interview that they were looking to build a new team for the format but did not divulge when would be the right time to bring those changes.
""Those who are there will make up the squad but then question becomes why those players didn't feature in the West Indies?"" Fahim asked.
""Whether we have enough players to build a new team or enhance bench strength, considering the time we have left for the World Cup, is a question. We have to think of a final team and put them in for the upcoming assignments before the big event,"" he said.
Fahim opined that Bangladesh must get out of the loop of getting immediate results.
""We have to step away from trying to get immediate results. Whether it's the T20 World Cup or other events, we need to focus on the rebuilding process for the next one to one-and-a-half years. We need to look at the probable players and give them opportunities. 'A' team programs should also prioritise T20s.
""If you think of the immediate future and the World Cup, you will not be able to experiment. But the stage we are in, we need to experiment. It's important to find players who show the characteristics required for T20s. If you don't have the fearless attitude, it's difficult to play T20s. We need to identify such players,"" Fahim concluded.

The mega stars' absence has presented an opportunity for eager fringe players to shine at the expense of a team that was swept 3-0 by Bangladesh in Guyana last week. West Indies captain Nicholas Pooran complained about both the quality of pitches against the Bangladeshis at Providence and the early start time which he felt conspired to favour the team bowling first too heavily for there to be an even contest. ""We have players quite capable of batting for long periods but we need to get it together and hold strong,"" said West Indies coach Phil Simmons.

Akram's comments came close on the heels of England all-rounder Ben Stokes' sudden retirement from ODIs, which has triggered a serious debate over the existence of 50-over cricket. Akram, while speaking on The Telegraph's Vaughany and Tuffers Cricket Club podcast, backed Stokes' decision to retire from ODIs and said that the format feels like a drag right now even as a commentator. He also said that T20s are easier and it is quite tiring for a player to play the 50-over matches. ""T20 is kind of easier, four hours the game is over.

In England you have full houses. In India, Pakistan especially, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, South Africa, one-day cricket you are not going to fill the stadiums."" ""They are doing it just for the sake of doing it.

It's kind of run-of-the-mill,"" said Akram. The Pakistan cricket legend also said that Tests are his favorite format of the game, saying that the five-day match was where a player used to get recognised. ""There's a battle within the battle in Test cricket,"" he said. ""I always preferred Test matches. One-day used to be fun but Test matches were where you were recognised as a player where people still pick you for the world XIs. OK money matters - I understand where they are coming from - but they should also remember if they want to be recognised as one of the greats of the game,"" said Akram."

The last Sussex batsman to post a double century at the Home of Cricket was India opener Pujara's compatriot, Colonel H. H. Shri Sir Ranjitsinhji Vibhaji II. KS Ranjitsinji, or 'Ranji' as he was popularly known, scored his double hundred in a match against the MCC 125 years ago. Pujara's 231 was his third double century of the season. An innings that started on Tuesday during London's hottest day on record saw the 34-year-old Pujara occupy the crease for nearly nine hours before he was last man out having guided the visitors to 523 -- a total that surpassed Sussex's previous highest score at Lord's of 522 set in 2005. Ranji, the ruler of the Indian princely state of Nawanagar from 1907 to 1933, has long been regarded as one of cricket's most stylish batsmen and is widely credited with inventing the leg-glance. Educated at Cambridge University, he played 15 Tests for England from 1896-1902, with India not becoming a Test nation in its own right until 1932 --just a year before Ranji's death aged 60."

Benzema has joined up with Real in Los Angeles this week after being granted an extended vacation by the club. Benzema's talismanic performances -- and goals -- were largely responsible for helping Real win a record 14th European Champions League crown in May. Although earlier reports suggested Benzema would play no part in Saturday's Clasico, manager Carlo Ancelotti picked the striker to lead the line in a practice game at the UCLA Campus on Thursday, alongside Federico Valverde and Brazilian star Vinicius. Ancelotti is also likely to give a run-out to new signings Antonio Rudiger, who joined from English club Chelsea, and former Monaco midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni. ""The signings bring great quality to the squad,"" Ancelotti said this week. ""They are in the best we could find on the market. Rudiger is a great centre-back and Tchouameni is great, very young and has a lot of potential."" 'Never an exhibition' Ancelotti has hinted that he may use Real's three-game US tour as an opportunity to experiment with his forward line, citing the unusual mid-season disruption that will come this year due to the first ever World Cup being held in the middle of the European football calendar. ""Benzema is first choice but we have to understand that it will be a strange season, with the World Cup in between and we have to look at different options,"" Ancelotti said. One of those options may involve deploying Eden Hazard as a false nine, Ancelotti said. While many pre-season games often have the feel of glorified practice games, Ancelotti insisted that the mutual antipathy between Real and Barcelona ensured that Saturday's clash would have an edge. ""It will be a very, very competitive match. It is never an exhibition against Barcelona. It will be a spectacle,"" Ancelotti said. Ancelotti's Barcelona counterpart, Xavi Hernandez, will also have the chance to run the rule over the club's summer signings. Bayern Munich sharpshooter Lewandowski is the club's marquee acquistion, but Barcelona have also invested heavily to bring in Brazilian forward Raphina from Leeds as well as midfielder Franck Kessie from AC Milan and defender Andreas Christensen from Chelsea. Lewandowski was unveiled by Barcelona on Wednesday but did not play in the previous night's 6-0 thrashing of Inter Miami. The Polish star is desperate to get to work though with his new teammates and could be set for a Clasico debut on Saturday. ""I am always hungry to succeed and have the winning mentality,"" Lewandowski said this week. ""This is a new challenge for me and I have already seen this is a squad with huge potential. ""There is a lot of quality and I want to do my best for the club. I am ready."""

The Reds brought striker Nunez to Anfield from Benfica last month for a transfer fee which could rise to a club-record 100 million euros (£85 million, $105 million). The Uruguayan, who scored 34 goals last season, had been criticised by some supporters after failing to score in Liverpool's first pre-season games against Manchester United and Crystal Palace. But he came on at half-time against Leipzig in Germany with Liverpool leading 1-0 thanks to a Mohamed Salah goal and scored a penalty before going on to net another three times. ""Mo gives Darwin the penalty and Darwin, Pandora's box was open,"" Klopp told liverpoolfc.com. ""That's of course a perfect night for him. ""We always think that if you pay a lot of money then the players feel no pressure or whatever. ""They are all completely normal human beings and the first touch is not perfect then all of a sudden... This generation of players read social media, which is really not smart, but they do. ""All of a sudden you get in a rush and these kinds of things. That's the best way obviously to stop all these discussions."" Liverpool, who won the FA Cup and League Cup titles last season but finished as runners-up in the Premier League and Champions League, face Manchester City in the Community Shield curtain-raiser next weekend. The 23-year-old Nunez will be expecting to be a key member of Klopp's squad after the departure of Sadio Mane to Bayern Munich. ""I think everybody is really happy for him and was looking for him (in the dressing room),"" centre-back Joel Matip said. ""Great finish, great speed and the body he always puts in –- I think it will be really difficult for our opponents."" Liverpool open their Premier League campaign at promoted Fulham on August 6."

""My only criticism of Sadio is that maybe at times he is the only one not to realise just how good he is.""Juergen Klopp, Liverpool head coach 
The 30-year-old left the Premier League club last month after signing a three-year deal with Bayern Munich.

""Thanks to my coaches, my club and national team colleagues and those friends who stood by me during difficult times.""
Mane was in the Moroccan capital to receive the award after a dash across the Atlantic having converted a penalty for his new club in a 6-2 pre-season friendly win over DC United in Washington on Wednesday.

It was the second successive continental player of the year award for Mane after the coronavirus pandemic forced the cancellation of the last two editions.
He won ahead of former Liverpool teammate Mohamed Salah from Egypt and fellow Senegal international and Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy.
Mane and Salah played pivotal roles last season with Liverpool, who lifted the FA Cup and English League Cup and finished runners-up in the Premier League and Champions League.
Salah has since signed a new contract at Anfield while Mane opted for a move, with Bayern reportedly paying an initial 32 million euros ($32.5 million) that could rise to 41 million euros.
The transfer fee was a far cry from the four million euros Red Bull Salzburg paid Metz in 2012 when Mane made his first move in Europe.
Decisive penalties 
In February, Mane converted the decisive fifth penalty to give Senegal a 4-2 shootout victory over Egypt and a first Africa Cup of Nations title after the final ended 0-0 in Yaounde.
A month later, Mane was once again the shootout match-winner against Egypt, this time in a World Cup play-off near Dakar after a 1-1 aggregate stalemate.
Salah did not get a chance to take a penalty in the Cup of Nations decider while he blazed the first Egyptian kick wide in the play-off that secured a World Cup place in Qatar this November for Senegal.
Born in a village nearly 400 kilometres (250 miles) from Dakar, Mane attracted the attention of Metz having played for local second-tier club Generation Foot.
After enhancing his reputation at Salzburg, Mane joined Southampton, where his feats included scoring a record-breaking 176-second Premier League hat-trick against Aston Villa.
In mid-2016 the Senegalese signed for Liverpool and went on to form a fearsome front three with Salah and Brazilian Roberto Firmino.
As Mane moved to Bayern, Liverpool manager said Jurgen Klopp said: ""My only criticism of Sadio is that maybe at times he is the only one not to realise just how good he is.""

3076511,West Germany's iconic 1966 captain Uwe Seeler passes away,22-07-2022,/sports/football/news/west-germanys-iconic-1966-captain-uwe-seeler-passes-away-3076511,sports,"Uwe Seeler, one of the iconic figures of post-war German football and who skippered West Germany in the 1966 World Cup final, has died at the age of 85, officials said Thursday. ""Hamburg mourns Uwe Seeler. He was the first top scorer in the Bundesliga. He has now died surrounded by his loved ones,"" said a statement by the municipality of Hamburg, the city where he spent his club career. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also commented on Twitter: ""He was a role model for many, we will miss him,"" he said. Seeler, who was born in 1936, made his debut for Hamburg in 1953 and went on to make 476 appearances before his retirement in 1972. He was later club president but resigned in 1998 because of a financial scandal in which he was not implicated. Seeler played a total of 72 matches for West Germany between 1954 to 1970, scoring 33 goals but never won a World Cup. He was, however, the major architect of the reconstruction of German football after the Second World War, which went hand in hand with the reconstruction of the country. Fourth in the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, and beaten in the quarter-finals in 1962, Seeler's finest moment was captaining the West Germany team that reached the 1966 final at Wembley, albeit losing 4-2 to hosts England after extra-time. It remains arguably the most famous World Cup final ever because of the controversy which still rumbles on over whether Geoff Hurst's goal to put England 3-2 up actually crossed the line. Hurst's shot beat goalkeeper Hans Tilkowski, the ball hit the underside of the crossbar, bounced on the line before being headed away by defender Wolfgang Weber."

It is not a secret that an important goal of the club is to become the best club at the region."" Bashundhara Kings coach Oscar Bruzon
Having strengthened their foothold in the domestic circuit by winning a third consecutive Bangladesh Premier League title, Bashundhara Kings are setting their sights on becoming the best club in South Asia. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. 
Under the guidance of Oscar Bruzon, Bashundhara Kings have won six out of trophies they competed for since their debut in top-flight football in 2018-19 season, but they are yet to taste success in the international arena.
They've exited from the group stages of the AFC Cup twice after their maiden appearance was cancelled due to the pandemic.



The 45-year-coach believes the club is in the right direction in their target of becoming the best club in the South Asian zone.    
""The journey has been positive so far at the international competitions [AFC Cup] too as we have finished runners-up two times in the South Asian group, where champions of important leagues participate. We have lost just one game in three participations. We are well aware that the expectations around our club are huge. It is not a secret that an important goal of the club is to become the best club at the region,"" Bruzon told The Daily Star yesterday.
The club made a flying start in their debut appearance in AFC Cup by inflicting a massive 5-1 defeat on Maldives' TC Sports Club before the edition was cancelled due to the pandemic. In the two subsequent seasons, Kings finished behind eventual group champions ATK Mohun Bagan, falling behind on goal difference despite having equal six points the last time around.  



Analysts say that the difference between the local players of Bangladesh and India is what makes the difference in the end at this stage. Bruzon, however, wants to keep faith in their own process to get success.
""We truly trust the process; good things take time, but the tendency of the team is positive. We follow our own path which is done with careful, distinct and solid steps,"" Bruzon said. ""There are multiple areas of improvement at different levels, both internal and external. In our case, as coaches we work consciously towards improving those aspects we can control being very close to each and all of our players.""
The club's technical director, BA Jubair Input, confirmed that they are going to recruit three new foreign players to replace Gambian forward Noha Morang, Brazilian midfielder Miguel Figueira and Iranian defender Khaled Shafiei for next season afte extending contract with inspirational Brazilian forward Robson Robinho by two more years.
Though Bruzon is willing to discuss about the new transfers after the completion of the ongoing league, there are whispers the club is trying to rope in Abahani's Brazilian forward Dorielton Gomes and Saif SC's Uzbek midfielder Asror Gafurov alongside a top-quality foreign defender.
It has also been learnt that Bashundhara Kings want to sign up a local centre-back, the position they suffered mostly during this season  following a knee injury to top local centre-back Tapu Barman.

Bangladesh lost 1-2 to India in the final of the last edition in 2019, when Bangladesh's defender Yeasin Arafat was given his marching orders after receiving a second yellow for taking off his jersey to celebrate his equaliser. Yeasin, now a national team and Bashundhara Kings players, was drafted in the initial squad of the U-20 squad along with national defender Rimon Hossain of Bashundhara Kings, but they were not part of the U-20 sqaud since the club did not release the players due to Bangladesh Premier League engagements. Due to the unavailability of players engaged in the BPL, coach-cum-technical director Paul Smalley is pinning his hopes on players from the BFF Elite Football Academy and Bangladesh Championship League, but he promised to fight for a spot in the final.

The Games will now be held in Hangzhou from September 23 to October 8 2023, the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) said. The event was originally scheduled to be held in September this year, but organisers in May postponed it as China tried to stamp out a large Covid resurgence in several parts of the country. Hangzhou lies less than 200 kilometres (120 miles) from the country's biggest city Shanghai, which endured a months-long lockdown earlier this year as part of the ruling Communist Party's zero-tolerance approach to the virus. The OCA said on Tuesday that the new dates were chosen to avoid ""conflict with other major international sporting events"". The Asian Games typically attract over 10,000 athletes from across the region. China is the last major economy committed to stamping out domestic spread of the virus through harsh lockdowns, mass testing and strict controls on international travel. But that has hurt the country's international sporting ambitions, with the world's most populous nation cancelling or postponing almost all events since the start of the pandemic, with the exception of this year's Winter Olympics in Beijing. The World University Games, scheduled to begin in June in Chengdu and already delayed from last year, have also been postponed again, until 2023."

The 25-year-old three-time Grand Slam winner stunned the sporting world with her bombshell retirement in March, just weeks after becoming the first home Australian Open champion in 44 years. Barty had been coy on what she would do next, but has always been a keen golfer, winning the Brookwater Golf Club women's title near Brisbane in 2020 and playing the Icons Series exhibition in the United States in April. It heightened speculation that the multi-talented Australian, who has also been a professional cricketer, could take up golf seriously. But in an interview with Melbourne radio late Monday she put the rumours to bed, ruling out playing any form of professional sport again. ""You guys just can't accept that I don't want to play professional sport any more,"" Barty said. ""I love golf, it's a hobby of mine. It will not be my profession, I have no intention of making it my profession but I hack around once a week if I can.

3073046,Smith rides back-nine charge to win the British Open,18-07-2022,/sports/golf/news/smith-rides-back-nine-charge-win-the-british-open-3073046,sports,"Cameron Smith staged one of the greatest back-nine charges ever witnessed at a major championship, coming from four shots behind to win the 150th British Open on Sunday as Rory McIlroy saw another major slip through his fingers. Smith, winner of golf's unofficial fifth major, The Players Championship, earlier this year, carded a sensational final round eight-under 64 that included a spectacular run of five consecutive birdies from the turn to become the first Australian to hoist the Claret Jug since Greg Norman in 1993. The 28-year-old Queenslander also became the first Australian man to claim one of golf's four majors since Jason Day's victory at the 2015 PGA Championship. ""All the names on there, every player that's been at the top of their game has won this championship,"" said Smith, adding he had no plans to get rid of his famous mullet hairstyle. ""It's pretty cool to be on there. ""It really hasn't sunk in yet. I don't think it will for a few weeks."" Smith's winning total of 20-under 268 was one better than playing partner American Cameron Young, who eagled the last for a 65 to finish alone in second while McIlroy, the betting favourite coming into St Andrews, faltered at the finish to settle for third. McIlroy started the final round tied for the lead with Viktor Hovland four strokes clear of the pack and an end to his eight-year major drought looked in sight as he moved two shots ahead alone in first. The four-time major winner's conservative game plan had appeared to work to perfection as he carded an error free two-under 70. But in the end fortune favoured the brave as Smith's go-for-broke approach ended with him being crowned Champion Golfer of the Year. It was another cruel near miss for McIlroy who now has top-10 finishes in all four of this season's majors, adding a third place at St Andrews to a runner-up result at the Masters and a fifth-placed finish at the U.S. Open. ""I felt like I didn't do much wrong today, but I didn't do much right either,"" summed up McIlroy. ""It's just one of those days where I played a really controlled round of golf. ""I did what I felt like I needed to. At the end of the day, it's not life or death. ""It's one that I feel like I let slip away, but there will be other opportunities."" LOW SCORES As McIlroy and Hovland set out under overcast skies they no doubt noticed the low scores put up by early starters like Sadom Kaewkanjana of Thailand and Mexico's Abraham Ancer who were in the clubhouse with seven-under 65s. For Smith and Young the message was received -- the Claret Jug was still within reach. The world number two had preached patience the entire week and was doing just that as he reached the turn without a bogey, a single birdie good enough to keep him two shots ahead of a trio of challengers -- Hovland, Smith and Young. Yet while McIlroy was practising patience, Smith was mounting a devastating all-out attack, firing five straight birdies to start the back nine, knocking McIlroy from the top of the leaderboard. ""I sometimes think that being behind on certain golf courses and in certain situations is maybe a good thing,"" said Smith. ""I think it's very easy to get defensive out there and keep hitting it to 60, 70 feet, and you can make pars all day, but you're not going to make birdies. ""I think it was a good thing that I was definitely behind. ""I think my mindset would have been a touch different coming in, especially on that back nine, if I was ahead."" One more birdie at the 18th and all that was left for Smith to do was to wait and see if McIlroy, playing the pair behind him, could eagle the last to force a playoff. Smith was not celebrating just yet, knowing anything was possible having watched Young roll in a 15-foot eagle putt at the 18th to join him momentarily on 19-under, until he drained his short birdie to clinch the Jug. The 28-year-old earned $2.5 million for his win but that could be only a small fraction of the fortune awaiting him if media reports are true that he is about to sign on with the big-money Saudi-backed LIV Golf Invitational Series. LIV Golf has poached several top golfers away from the PGA Tour, luring them to the rebel circuit with multi-million dollar guaranteed contracts. Smith batted away questions about joining them saying he leaves that business to his team. ""I don't know, mate. My team around me worries about all that stuff,"" said Smith. ""I'm here to win golf tournaments."""

The superstar has graduated with a Masters in Bengali Literature. On the occasion, she shared a Facebook status to commemorate the moment. The actress completed her Honours and Masters in Bengali literature from Southeast University.  The convocation ceremony was initially scheduled to take place in 2020.  Unfortunately, due to the coronavirus pandemic, it was delayed. The Facebook post read: ""Today is one of the most important days of my life. My education has officially ended, as today is my convocation. Even then, better late than never, finally the convocation has happened. I would like to thank Southeast University for organising this convocation. At the same time, I would like to thank each of my teachers, who have helped me on my journey to completing my education. Working in the media, while also continuing my studies was not easy of course.

3075916,Yet another musical marvel from Meghdol,21-07-2022,/entertainment/music/news/yet-another-musical-marvel-meghdol-3075916,entertainment,"When I noticed that Meghdol had released a song for the film ""Hawa"", while scrolling through my YouTube homepage, I somehow knew that I would not be disappointed. Of course, this was a hunch owing to my eternal love for Meghdol. However, what I did not expect was to be moved by it to the extent that I was. It has been years since a piece of music managed to sincerely and deeply pull at my heartstrings to the level ""E Hawa"" has been able to. I did not have the best day and stayed in bed past twilight—I did not bother to get up and switch on the lights during Maghrib, the curtains remained drawn. I had already seen the music video for the song upon its release, but when I played the song this time, it hit me differently. As the soft music began, images of a beautiful teal sea—which I had witnessed just the day before in the music video—flooded my mind. Close shots of a boat rocking against the turbulent sea; two men sitting on it desolately. When the song picked up, the singer's voice reverberated through my room, and for a moment, it was almost like I was there with him on his voyage. There is an earthly quality in singer-songwriter Shibu Kumer Shill's voice, one that always managed to strike a chord with me. Meghdol's past songs, including the likes of ""Esho Amar Shohore"", ""Akash Meghe Dhaka"", ""Shohor Bondhi Megh"", and ""Na Bola Phul"", have always been my top picks in terms of Bangladeshi music. Now, ""E Hawa"" will also forever stay with me. Shill's velveteen voice urging this 'Hawa', pleading with her to disclose where she's taking him, is heart wrenching to hear. The way he implores her—whether it is the violent wind steering the rickety boat off course or the siren-like girl clad in a red saree—it almost compelled me to feel the distress behind the lyrics. The starting guitar solo, eventually going on to find the vocals and drums, creates yet another layer of sentiment and elevation to the composition. The heaviness of the instruments create a sublime combination to encapsulate what was going on the screen: the rumbling storm. The flute, clarinet, saxophone, along with the guitars and drums, all coming together to meet the vocalist, as his voice soared to a crescendo, leaving his baritone and becoming almost hollow—it felt as though I was, somehow, caught in the middle of that storm projected on the screen. The monochromatic fixtures of the ship swaying in the wind, flashes of blaring red light, it all came together to tug some profound and unfeigned emotion out of me. At that moment, it felt as though I could cry. I think I finally understand why people get so emotional during string quartet orchestras. Sitting in my small, dark room, I realise the power that a well composed piece of music can have on people. The song, in coming down from its peak, lulled me back into safety, away from the storm of emotions I felt all this time. This song is perhaps one of those rare, complete, and beautiful pieces of stories, that will surely stay with me forever. And even though I will always have so many things to say about it, I can never truly point out exactly why it spoke to me with so much meaning and heart."
3076826,Winter captured marvelously by Anurup Kanti Das ,22-07-2022,/entertainment/theatre-arts/news/winter-captured-marvelously-anurup-kanti-das-3076826,entertainment,"We are always fascinated by the amazing beauty of nature. None can delve deep into nature the way an artist can. When the unconditional offerings of nature mingle with the utmost sincerity of an artist, there happens a magic that we call art. Anurup Kanti Das is such a visual artist, who tries to capture the essence of nature in an aesthetic way that speaks through serenading nature's own songs. Taking photography as his forte, Anurup, who currently lives in Helsinki, Finland, blissfully roams around nature and creates an orchestration of images zooming in on the serenity of nature together—with human beings' in close proximity of it—indulging in the socio-cultural aspects of life, while sharing a nostalgic love affair with the city he lives in. John Keats's famous excerpt, ""A thing of beauty is joy forever…"" from the poem ""Ode to a Grecian Urn"" holds true, considering Anurup's dedication towards the visual arts. He went to many lengths and even had to withstand the shivering winter, to arrest the exquisite images of Helsinki. With several selected images, Anurup Kanti Das's maiden solo exhibition titled ""Whiteness of the North"" is being held at Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin Gallery of Zilla Shilpakala Academy, Chattogram, for the visual art lovers of the port city. Renowned poet and journalist Abul Momen inaugurated the exhibition as chief guest on July 21. The exhibition, opening daily from 4 pm to 8 pm, will conclude on July 23. The season 'Winter' has its unique beauty. Anurup marvelously captured the pristine beauty of nature in an array of images ranging from the snow-covered nature to the Finnish lifestyle, cultural nuances and nostalgia. The multi-award-winning artist also served as a photojournalist in Dainik Purbokone, Dainik Suprobhat Bangladesh and The Daily Star. Following his footprints in Helsinki, Finland, he had to quit his profession of photojournalism, but he never ceased to taking snaps. Even with his cell phone, he took beautiful images to satisfy his inner passion. The exhibit is an outcome of his cell-phone photography. The showcased images are well-composed with a detailed depiction of subjects, objects, perspectives, colour combinations and a soothing game of light and shade.     The changing courses of nature attract Anurup a lot. Here he has prominently portrayed the mysteries of winter. The solitary island nearing the Helsinki harbour is a great, visual delight. There remains a grave silence where snow has covered almost everything from the branches and leaves, to the surface of the roadside parks along with the chairs and walkways in it. The snow-covered cars, bikes and balconies appear to be unused for a long time. Yet, trams, cars and metro rails ply on the roads for the city dwellers. Human activity is rather limited during the season. The photographer waited for a long time to take the best images of humans' outdoor activity. Anurup Kanti Das wishes to take the ephemeral beauty of Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights for his next solo exhibition."

The book not only carries a chronological history of the development of Bangladeshi band music, but also the authentic profiles of over 170 bands along with their discographies. Haque, now a senior journalist, and Milu, a full-fledged writer, have worked separately as music-journalists for many years. ‌With their combined experience, and almost two years of relentless effort, the duo will publish their book, ""Banglar Rock Metal"" on August 5. ‌Haque said that he has spent hours at the archive section of different libraries working on this book. The duo not only depended on the existing documents but also decided to record the oral history of living band members. ""We crosschecked the information with the former band members who are still alive. It was an arduous process, and we had to go above and beyond to track down and contact some of the musicians. Some of them have also been living in different parts of the world for decades now,"" said ‌Haque. ‌""For example, the members of the 90s band Aces now live abroad, scattered across different countries. They also found it difficult to recall their glory days, as it has been a very long time since they were in their prime. So, we created a group chat on social media, and gave them plenty of time to sit down and recall the decade-old memories,"" explained Milu. ""We followed their conversations from the group and noted down what one can call an almost erased histories,"" said the co-author. This book is being published by Aajob Prokash. The book cover was designed by Niaz Ahmed Aungshu, the cover typography was done by Mustafiz Karigar and the essential graphics were done by Kousik Zaman. ‌Publisher Joy Shahriar, a renowned musician and founder of Aajob Prokash, said that they are all set for a book launching ceremony on August 5. However, the venue has not been decided as of yet. ‌""Pre-orders are open till launching, but we have already received an overwhelming response from the 'band-music' fans. Currently, we are estimating that the first-print run of the book will be out of stock as soon it is launched,"" said Joy. ‌According to Joy, this book has enabled the nation to overcome the reluctant culture of not preserving and documenting our history in a proper manner. ""Banglar Rock Metal"" can be pre-ordered via the Facebook page of Aajob Prokash at a discounted price. ""As the price of the 450-page hardbound book will be around BDT 1000, it might cause students and young music-enthusiasts to struggle to buy the book. That is why we wanted to provide a discount for these fans during the pre-order campaign,"" added Joy. Ziaur Rahman Zia, band leader and bassist of Shironamhin said that this was a much-needed initiative, and that he is happy that someone took on the responsibility to give people an authentic record of the country's band-music history. ‌""The importance of archiving has always been relevant, and we're really fortunate that this talented duo, who witnessed the scene for almost four decades, successfully took this initiative,"" said Zia. ‌"

The singer wrote an emotional post which read: ""Ever since I could comprehend the world around me, I have witnessed my parents' regret over having a dark-skinned daughter. I never saw my relatives hesitate to compare me to my elder brother, claiming that I am not as pretty as him."" The singer also went on to say that she was judged in a variety of other ways simply because she does not adhere to social conventions. ""Because I don't like a lot of people or noise, I was labeled as unsocial. As I am not interested in cooking, I was deemed to not be 'marriage material',"" elaborated Nancy. She also wrote that she was told she was not a good mother, because she would not coddle her children all the time. Nancy then went on to write, ""People have said I am incapable of love, simply because I cannot hold back my anger at times. That I am not a good wife, because I have multiple failed marriages. I only know how to sing; thus, I do not know the meaning of 'hard work'."" The artist also mentioned that she was told that she was not 'neat and clean' because she did not properly apply makeup.

I can't dress the way I like, can't live my life on my terms, or die the way I want. Just because I am Nancy…"" Comments started pouring in after the singer posted this status.

3074356,J-Hope dives into darkness with ‘Jack in the Box’,20-07-2022,/entertainment/music/news/j-hope-dives-darkness-jack-the-box-3074356,entertainment,"J-Hope of BTS fame made his debut as a solo artist with his latest album ""Jack in the Box"". On the album, J-Hope showcased that he was not afraid to embrace the reality of the world, and that he was ready to work his way through any broken path or challenge to reach his goals. The 22-minute long album starts with an introduction track titled ""Intro"", that tells the tale of Pandora's Box. The female narrator for ""Intro"" says, ""It was Hope that was kept in the innermost nook of the box. It trailed behind the miasma of darkness, assuaging the ill effects on humankind. Hope gave people the will to keep on living amidst the pain and strife."" While J-Hope's 2018 mixtape ""Hope World"", was full of colours and shared the artist's gratitude for his life and work, ""Jack in the Box"" is full of darkness. This contrast of light and dark is prevalent throughout the album, with the artist hinting that 'hope' is the only thing helps us survive the darkness of life. Using the sounds of hip-hop, rap-rock, R&B, and grunge, J-Hope was able to shock fans with a new and unique sound that they previously did not associate with the artist. While listening to the first single of this album ""More"", I was stunned because I had never expected to see this version of J-Hope in my dreams, let alone in reality. This album is almost like a storybook, which one needs to approach chronologically, with all 10 tracks acting like 10 chapters of a novel. ""Stop"", followed by ""More"", gave us an idea of the ideals with which J-Hope lives his life, particularly the philosophy that there are no 'bad people' in this world. The artist questions if people are truly black and white, which to him does not make sense. Instead, he feels that people are almost like the different shades of grey, where it is impossible to label them as just good or bad. Eventually, J-Hope asks listeners to stop the judgement and calm down. ""= (Equal Sign)"" is another song with a message, that asks to put a stop to the endless discrimination that we engage in and face ourselves in this world. J-Hope tries to send the message that everyone, irrespective of age, gender, and borders, are equal. By the end of the song, the artist urges people to not fill their hearts and minds with hate, as this will only paralyse them; leaving us with the message that it costs nothing to be kind. The first half of the album tells us the story of Jack, which in this case is J-Hope himself, who is living inside a box, hoping to eventually get out. After the interlude, ""Music Box: Reflection"", it is presumed that Jack has finally escaped from his box, and now is finally able to see that life no longer looks the same as it did from inside. From questioning what would he would be without the success and fame he has now, to thinking about the future, J-Hope bares it all on ""Jack in the Box"". The album ends with the song ""Arson"", saying, ""Do I put out the fire, or burn even brighter?"""

3075111,The Colors of Youth: celebrating art across communities,20-07-2022,/entertainment/theatre-arts/news/the-colors-youth-celebrating-art-across-communities-3075111,entertainment,"""The Colors of Youth"", an exhibition run by Abu Subhan Welfare Trust (ASWT), was inaugurated at the capital's Saifuddin Shilpalay, recently. The exhibition displayed artworks by underprivileged students from the indigenous communities residing in Bangladesh. The inaugural ceremony began with a welcome address by Nushin Subhan. Monsur Choudhury, the trustee of ASWT, then took to the stage, speaking about the life and work, and vision of Abu Subhan. Abu Subhan, who always dreamt of becoming a painter, loved his surroundings dearly. He saw the struggles of tea estate workers, and decided to form a trust to help indigenous children fund their passion. Today, fifteen years after his demise, Abu Subhan's Trust, with six members, offers scholarships to fine arts students based on their merit and needs. Abu Subhan, being the only Bangladeshi fellow in the Royal Art Society of the UK, paved the way for indigenous youngsters to use their skills to their fullest potential. Abu Subhan was the CEO of Duncan Brothers in Bangladesh. His wife, Nasreen Subhan, carries the torch of ASWT on his behalf.   Lumbiny Dewan, a former artist and scholar of ASWT, spoke about the challenges of studying in an expensive city like Dhaka, especially for the ones who hail from remote areas with very limited resources. She thanked Abu Subhan and ASWT for their efforts. Renowned artist and sculptor Hamiduzzaman Khan attended the event as special guest. He expressed his admiration for Abu Subhan and praised the curator of this successful event, Kanak Chanpa Chakma. Her Excellency Nathalie Chuard, the ambassador of Switzerland in Bangladesh, said, indigenous cultures are important to protect the environment and her homeland always upholds the striving minority groups. Kanak Chanpa Chakma, a 'key artist of Rangamati' in Hamiduzzaman's opinion, talked spoke about the lack of resources and funds when it comes to promoting children to practice art. The formal programme concluded with a few cultural performances from the students of Camellia Duncan Foundation School. This was followed by the opening ceremony. The paintings portrayed several aspects of the indigenous communities in Bangladesh -- their livelihoods, culture and their artifacts. Artworks like ""Village"" and ""Allegory of Nature"" demonstrated the deep bond between nature and these suburb dwellers. The artist of 'Pena' used the seven prominent colors representing all the Manipuri communities of the world. Along with their cultural instrument and letters, she also included the widely known patterns we see on Manipuri sarees. Upon entering the exhibition space, you would see Lumbiny Dewan's eye-catching water-lilies and jarul flowers. The exhibition also showcases still-life pieces and recycled artworks alongside the symbolic and thought-provoking paintings from talented artists with the mediums acrylic, watercolors, mixed medium and pen-ink. The exhibition is open for all till July 21. The writer is an architecture graduate, a freelance artist, and a designer."
3074206,Portraying the bucolic beauty of Bangladesh  ,21-07-2022,/entertainment/theatre-arts/news/portraying-the-bucolic-beauty-bangladesh-3074206,entertainment,"Renowned artist Samar Majumder's third solo exhibition, titled 'Soul Searching: A Personal Journey' took place at the contemporary art gallery Shilpangan, Lalmatia in the capital. The month-long exhibition concludes tomorrow. The artist's singular style occupies time-honoured folk motifs and Bengali ballads. Throughout his entire life and artistic career, Samar Majumder persistently experiments with newer modes of expression - his compositions are natural in essence, as they relate to the soul, soil and the bucolic beauty of Bangladesh. He consciously takes his artistic muse and strength from human feelings and emotions.   Art lovers can easily connect his simplistic forms that engage his ideas in a dialectical exploration of metaphors, nuances and meanings. Yet, at the same time, they depict different expressive modes. Folk art has got a new lease of life, thanks to the dedicated creative efforts by the artist. He continues to experiment with the conventional folk motifs and creates his own works blending those with the touch of modernity.  Following the folk-traditions of Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin, Patua Quamrul Hassan, Safiuddin Ahmed, SM Sultan, Jamini Roy and other master artists, the prominent features in Samar's works include varied connotations of folk elements such as tepa putul, sora, nakshi kantha, design of homemade cake, jar, boat, bird, tree, river, fish, crop, flower, fruit, animal and the life sketches of rural people. Samar Majumder's compositions are bordered with free-flowing thick brush lines set on a thin layered colour background.  His sketches retain only the bare essentials, sometimes employing just a brief line to cover for a whole figure. Yet, they are immensely expressive. Mature hues and a lyrical colour balance are prominent features of his body of works.  Closely observing the lives of village people, artisans, farmers and the nature of rural Bangladesh, the artist has adeptly depicted common characters of pastoral Bangladesh. The 'rakhal' playing flute, fishermen's fishing in the river at night, house in coastal area, mother, angling whole day on a boat, framers' working in the field, village girl with her pet, girl with water lily and the musician are some of his prominent depictions for the ongoing exhibit.   His three-decade long career as an Assistant Chief Designer at BSCIC (Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation) helped him understand and support various artisans. At BSCIC, he also received mentorship from legendary artist Quamrul Hassan. He initially worked with textiles and tapestry, but his work allowed him to travel throughout the country where he got to know the lives of artisans and rural people. Samar Majumdar started painting in his early childhood. Later, he completed his academic studies from the Institute if Fine Arts, University of Dhaka in 1980. For the last four decades, he has been working on book cover designs and illustrations. He also garnered the best cover designer award from National Book Center six times."

The exhibition features multiple series of abstract, objective and non-objective paintings by the artist such as ""Horizon"", ""Memory"", ""Fragment"", ""My Journey"", ""Mindscape"", and ""Before Time"". Initially, the exhibition began on June 18 and is now set to be available at the gallery till July 23. ""Normally whenever we think about the horizon, we look as far as our vision can comprehend,"" said Azmeer Hossain. ""However, I cannot help but wonder what's beyond that. Every painting in this exhibition embodies the horizons of my mind, accumulating over my experience with nature, life, and my imagination."" Every painting in this exhibition expresses a unique sensation through the use of space and dimensions as if to give the viewers an insightful look towards the infinite horizon trapped in the canvas. ""Azmeer sir's work has always been fascinating as they represent so much more than what meets the eye,"" says Sanjida Sultana, a school teacher and passionate artist. ""His efforts and thoughts are apparent in his art. No wonder his paintings take months or even years to complete."" Taking a closer look, viewers may notice the vast multitude of layers used to perfectly portray the space between the subjects in the paintings in such a way so that it seamlessly mirrors reality. ""In our daily life we are living in a city that is filled with diversified textures, noises, forms, colours, sounds and smells,"" said renowned artist Syed Golam Dastagir. ""This chaotic and packed city is where Azmeer was born and brought up, and this has greatly influenced his art."" Watercolour has been a traditional medium in Bangladeshi art, dating from the Pala to Mughal eras. However, this particular type of watercolour was of an opaque quality. Later on, the British era introduced a new type of watercolour that belonged to the British impressionist school, which is transparent in nature. Azmeer Hossain is well known for his mastery over the use of watercolours. ""We are learning a lot about art every day. Yet, I feel the methods we use to create art should be equally researched,"" said the artist. After almost twenty-five years of studying and research, Azmeer Hossain came up with his own unique way of using watercolours. ""Suppose a buffalo stands before a tree. There is an obvious gap between the two subjects in reality, yet watercolour painting methods would not be able to express that gap in the canvas."" ""Over the years, I have developed my own way to remedy these flaws of watercolour,"" mentions Azmeer Hossain. ""This particular way of using watercolour has become my signature style."" ""In the future, I am hoping to spread my knowledge on watercolours to the next generation of artists,"" concluded Azmeer Hossain."

3077436,Gas crisis won’t create fertiliser shortage: agriculture minister,23-07-2022,/business/news/gas-crisis-wont-create-fertiliser-shortage-agriculture-minister-3077436,business,"There will be no fertiliser crisis in Bangladesh, even if the country faces shortage of gas, the key raw material for producing fertiliser, said Agriculture Minister Muhammad Abdur Razzaque. ""I have talked to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina about the fertiliser issue."" If the government does not get enough gas for fertiliser production, imported fertiliser will be supplied to the farmers, the minister said. Razzaque was addressing a seminar at the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council auditorium organised by the Bangladesh Academy of Agriculture (Baag) today. Although the price of fertilisers is high in the international market, the prime minister has given clear instructions so that there is no shortage of fertilisers in the country, he said. Natural gas is used as a raw material to produce ammonia, a source of nitrogen essential for plants. Then, ammonia is processed and combined with other nutrients, which are necessary for plants such as phosphorous and potassium, to produce different types of fertiliser. Razzaque also said the Russia-Ukraine war has caused an adverse impact on the global economy. ""So, food security is very crucial right now. There is a food crisis all over the world. In this case, Bangladesh is in a better position than other countries,"" he added."
3076516,"Regulatory moves target private sector, not public sector",22-07-2022,/business/economy/news/regulatory-moves-target-private-sector-not-public-sector-3076516,business,"Bangladesh Bank has recently taken some serious decisions, the speed and approach of which seem unusual.   Such hard decisions are supposed to come after intense negotiations among the top business organisations, the industries, commerce and finance ministries, and the Bangladesh Bank. It's surprising that decisions are suddenly made without involving the stakeholders in the negotiations. Apparently, the BB has taken major decisions to discourage imports except for food, fuel, and raw materials, the impact of which is far-reaching. If the necessary import economy too is discouraged in this way, the dollar will be saved for sure. But will export be saved too? Our exports depend on imports! And how to save the employment and the economy as a whole? Some of the decisions taken together to solve the dollar crisis are: a reduction in banks' dollar holding limit; the obligation to monetise 50 per cent of US dollars held in the Exporter's Retention Quota (ERQ) accounts; and the reduction of deposit limit as ERQ to half, halving of the deposit limit of realised export proceeds. The restrictions on the transfer of foreign currency funds from offshore to domestic banking units and transfer terms have been relaxed. An order to inform the central bank 24 hours before opening any private import letter of credit (LC) worth more than $5 million has been issued. In addition, there is a reporting obligation for transactions of $5 million or more. Earlier banks could reserve 20 per cent of their operational capital in foreign currency. The limit is now 15 per cent. However, this will lead to a shortage of funds in foreign currencies for importers. The purpose of extending the ERQ status was to save exporters' required dollars for the next imports, meet sudden needs and make payments hassle-free and fast. In this, exporters could save themselves from multi-stage currency conversion loss. If businessmen need money suddenly, they have to take permission from the Bangladesh Bank to meet all those liabilities. Simply put, the Bangladesh Bank's decision has made export-import a bit more difficult. Moreover, reducing the net open position (NOP) limit of commercial banks to 15 per cent will add another $569 million to the market but it will reduce the capacity of banks to provide LC service. The regulatory agency, on July 18, suspended the issuance of bonds worth about $2.5 million of five institutions. In the history of the central bank, there was no such incidence of withholding valid loan documents. Due to the fuel price hikes in the spot market, the government has reduced the import of fuel oil. Planned electricity load-shedding has started across the country by reducing the supply of gas and oil in the power sector. The government has a maximum fuel oil reserve of 40 days. This is a sign of an extended fuel crisis. The government has decided to stop diesel-based power generation of 1,125 megawatts for the time being. The burden of 'unjust' capacity charges from idle power plants has also increased. It was Tk 21,600 crore in the last financial year. The non-producing rental power plants are claiming $1.5 billion more! The government is going to take unexpected decisions like closing petrol pumps once a week, shutting shops after eight o'clock in the evening, enforcing compulsory load-shedding for 1-2 hours a day, and reducing office hours by 1-2 hours. In the private sector, which accounts for 89 per cent of the formal labour market, the government's contractionary policies have reached a peak. However, the government's own imports and public administration expenditure did not experience a major contraction. There is no initiative to stop unnecessary 'development' projects. There was no direct announcement of cancelling the contract of inefficient rental and quick rental power plants that produce less electricity by burning more fuel. Even in the electricity-fuel crisis, there is no new understanding of green power generation strategy. There is not enough 'fuel diplomacy' with OPEC's major oil and gas producers instead of a commission-friendly spot market for continuous and sustainable fuel supply. It is surprising to know that a 14-year-old government lacks so much in primary energy diplomacy. It does not have any large-scale constant fuel supply agreements with OPEC countries.  There is no implementation of available reform proposals to increase the country's gas production and offshore exploration. There is no effective initiative to discover new labour markets or means of remittance income by sending workers abroad at a lower cost. In other words, although contraction has been imposed in the private sector, there is not enough initiative to reduce the 'dollar expenditure' in the public sector. Some of Bangladesh Bank's initiatives as part of the monitoring framework are certainly useful. But the political integrity of regulatory audit of under-invoicing in exports, over-invoicing in imports, and monitoring of the number of dollars kept in Nostro accounts of private banks are missing. That is, rather than a direct effort to save the dollar, the government's efforts are inadequate and, in some cases, indirect. Discouraging the opening of LCs via several active and passive measures will have a profound impact on the economy. The obligation to open LCs at a 100 per cent margin means blocking the flow of trade capital, affecting both import and export trade. The price of goods will rise again. Much-needed imports too will be blocked, and industrial production will be disrupted. This will further increase inflation, reduce export earnings and will lead to layoffs and more misery in public life. Aberrant monetary policy in favour of 'cheap money and credit', running single-digit interest despite double-digit inflation, loaning more than the NBR and non-NBR revenue can sustain increased expenditure of public administration, unfair selling of government bonds to Bangladesh Bank, reckless money supply, mismanagement in the banking sector, policy in favour of black money, reducing collateral numbers in bank lending, and giving incredible opportunities to defaulters were all political decisions. It was the process of creating new riches and profit-centred 'development' policies. Due regulation was completely absent.   Now in crisis, we are seeing the severity of the regulatory decisions, yet the government is unable to take political decisions to reset the energy security policy. Good governance, accountability and transparency should also be the focus.  Foreign currency reserves are now $39.7 billion, according to the government, but $32.5 billion, according to the International Monetary Fund. But some sources claim that the EDF, non-investment grade bonds, reserve loans given to various government banks, development projects, loans given to Sri Lanka and Sudan etc are in the reserve accounts, but not in hand and not usable. At this point in time, expendable reserves are incredibly low. The massive waiver of interest rate to defaulters (4 per cent instead of 10 per cent) will not work and it never worked before. If the exporters have smuggled or laundered a part of the EDF loans, it should be audited properly by LC audit and the prime minister herself should take initiative to bring back the funds. The Bangladesh Bank policy will not work here because many of those loans were politically motivated. The author is a sustainable development critic. He can be reached at faiz.taiyeb@gmail.com"

3077286,Wheat prices fall to level last seen before Ukraine invasion,23-07-2022,/business/news/wheat-prices-fall-level-last-seen-ukraine-invasion-3077286,business,"Wheat prices tumbled Friday, retreating to levels last seen prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine following a landmark agreement to unblock Ukraine's Black Sea grain exports. In Chicago, the price of wheat for delivery in September dropped 5.9 per cent to $7.59 per bushel, which is equivalent to about 27 kilograms and the lowest close since Russia invaded its neighbor on February 24. On Euronext, wheat prices for delivery in September fell 6.4 per cent to $325.75 per ton. Friday's agreement between Kyiv and Moscow -- through United Nations and Turkish mediation -- establishes safe corridors along which Ukrainian ships can come in and out of three designated Black Sea ports in and around Odessa. Russia and Ukraine together produce about 30 per cent of the world's wheat exports. Up to 25 million tons of wheat and other grain have been blocked in Ukrainian ports by Russian warships and landmines Kyiv has laid to avert a feared amphibious assault. Despite Friday's retreat in wheat prices, analysts expressed skepticism about the accord's ability to sidestep the realities of the grinding Russia-Ukraine conflict amid doubts over Moscow's willingness to implement the deal. ""I'm still skeptical and I don't think I'm alone in that in questioning that it will actually move much grain,"" said Michael Zuzolo, president of Global Commodity Analytics & Consulting. But Zuzolo said wheat prices may not have much further to fall, given that drought conditions are hitting output in some other parts of Europe."
3076556,Forex crisis spills over to bond market,22-07-2022,/business/economy/news/forex-crisis-spills-over-bond-market-3076556,business,"Banks in Bangladesh are already in a tight liquidity situation since they have to buy US dollars at higher rates to settle import bills.  So, they are not keen to invest in the government's long-term securities and bonds although the investment tools offer much higher rates compared to a year ago. Rather, they are on the lookout for higher returns in order to make the most out of their limited funds. As a result, the government is struggling to raise funds from commercial banks to meet its expenditures by issuing Treasury bills and bonds with yields ranging from 6 per cent to 8.65 per cent. The yield ranged from 0.79 per cent to 6 per cent a year ago. In order to support the government, the central bank itself is investing in the securities in a massive way, a move that may fan inflation, which hit a nine-year high in June owing to the volatility in global commodity markets. Experts warn that banks' capacity to lend to the government will erode in the days to come due to the ongoing instability in the foreign exchange market of Bangladesh. The central bank has lent Tk 7,792 crore to the government so far in July through the purchase of T-bills and bonds. The government has set a bank borrowing target of Tk 106,000 crore for the current fiscal year. But it may overshoot the target owing to weak revenue collection. The government borrowed Tk 72,749 crore from banks last fiscal year in contrast to Tk 24,292 crore the year before. In the last fiscal year that ended on June 30, banks bought a record $7.62 billion of US dollars from the central bank with a view to meeting the demand of importers. This means a large amount of local currency was automatically mopped up, creating liquidity pressure in the banking system. Excess liquidity at banks stood at Tk 189,183 crore in May, down 11 per cent year-on-year. The central bank has injected $808 million into the money market in the first couple of weeks of the current fiscal year to keep the foreign exchange market stable. Bangladesh's international currency reserves fell to $39.67 billion on Wednesday in contrast to $46.15 billion in December, owing to abnormally high imports, which swelled by 39 per cent to $75.40 billion between July and May. Syed Mahbubur Rahman, managing director of Mutual Trust Bank, says the interest rates on the T-bills and bonds have increased significantly in recent months, but they are not good enough to draw banks. This is because many banks have to collect deposits at 7.50 per cent, which makes it difficult for them to invest in long-term T-bonds. The interest rate on the 10-year T-bond is 8.1 per cent. ""Nobody can predict the market behaviour, which is now facing liquidity pressure. Besides, a majority of deposits are short-term with tenures standing at six months and below,"" Rahman said. A BB official, on condition of anonymity, says that some lenders are quoting more than a 9 per cent interest rate at the auction of government securities. Since banks are seeking more than 9 per cent interest rate on government securities, the central bank is now purchasing those bills and bonds to keep the interest rate below 9 per cent, he said. ""The ongoing tight liquidity situation will improve thanks to the BB's investment in the securities,"" said Mirza Elias Uddin Ahmed, managing director of Jamuna Bank.  ""Such investment will create new money in the market."" However, there is a possibility that the BB's investment will leave an adverse impact on inflation. ""So, banks should place an emphasis on disbursing loans to the productive sector in order to offset the prices hike,"" Ahmed said. In Bangladesh, inflation raced to a nine-year high of 7.56 per cent in June. Ahsan H Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh, says that the central bank has recently taken a contractionary monetary policy to tackle inflationary pressure. ""It is now financing the government in a massive way, going against its tight monetary policy. But the central bank should not invest in government securities at this moment as it will stoke inflationary pressure."" According to Mansur, the only way to bring stability to the bond market is to withdraw the lending cap on loans. The central bank has been following a 9-per cent interest rate cap on all loans except credit cards since April 2020. It is now trying to follow the same in the bond market. Mansur also suggested the central bank not inject foreign currencies into the market massively as reserves are squeezing at a faster pace. ""State-run banks, which are now receiving the greenback from the BB to import petroleum and other essential commodities, should manage funds from other banks,"" he said. The former official of the International Monetary Fund thinks ensuring a floating exchange rate of the taka against the US dollar will help make the inter-bank forex platform vibrant as many lenders are showing reluctance to sell dollars using the window. Banks are now imposing much higher rates on importers than what the central bank has asked them to follow, rendering the inter-bank platform almost inoperative. The exchange rate of the taka stood at Tk 94.45 per USD yesterday, down 11.38 per cent year-on-year."
3076546,Dollar gets even pricier ,22-07-2022,/business/economy/news/dollar-gets-even-pricier-3076546,business,"The taka depreciated once again against the US dollar in the inter-bank platform yesterday.  The exchange rate stood at Tk 94.45 per dollar. It was Tk 93.95 on Wednesday. On July 21 last year, the rate was Tk 84.80, which means there has been a 11.38 per cent loss in value in a year. The country's foreign exchange market is facing a shortage of US dollars due to rising import payments and declining inflows of remittance. Import payments have been going up since the end of last year because of a rise in the prices of commodities in the global market. Between July and May of last fiscal year, import payments went up by 39 per cent year-on-year to $75.40 billion while exports grew 33 per cent to $44.58 billion. This resulted in a record trade deficit -- the gap between exports and imports -- of $30.81 billion, up 48.8 per cent year-on-year. The inflow of remittance, the cheapest source of foreign currencies for Bangladesh, fell 15 per cent year-on-year to $21.03 billion in fiscal year 2021-22. The country's foreign exchange reserves stood at $39.67 billion on Wednesday, in contrast to $46.15 billion in December last year. Bangladesh Bank injected $70 million into the market yesterday to keep the market stable, Md Serajul Islam, spokesperson for the central bank, told The Daily Star. The BB has so far injected $808 million in the market this fiscal year after supplying a record $7.62 billion last fiscal year. Ahsan H Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh, said the central bank should reduce the injection of dollars into the market to shield the reserves from the pitfalls of a declining trend. He said the state-run banks, which were now receiving the greenback from the central bank to import petroleum and other essential commodities, should manage the fund from other banks. Ensuring a floating exchange rate of the taka against the dollar will help turn the platform vibrant as many lenders are showing reluctance to sell dollars using the window, he said. Banks are now charging a much higher rate in selling dollars to importers than what the central bank had asked them to follow, which is why the inter-bank platform has almost become inoperative."

The listed multinational ceramics brand yesterday informed the Dhaka Stock Exchange of its decision, which follows the company's previous plan to enter the tiles market. Early last month, RAK Ceramics announced that it would invest Tk 902 in a greenfield facility to raise its tile production capacity by 15,000 square metres per day. ""As Bangladesh has huge potential in the coming days, we opted to increase production and grab a bigger share of the market,"" said Muhammad Shahidul Islam, company secretary of RAK Ceramics. ""Now, we are going to produce all bathroom fittings. We will soon start building the plant, which may take nearly a year to begin production,"" he added. Islam went on to say that at present, most locally produced bathroom fittings are of low standard but people prefer significantly more expensive high-quality products that are imported. So, RAK Ceramics aims to produce alternatives to these imports so that customers can get quality products at competitive prices."

3076531,Stocks drop for eighth day,22-07-2022,/business/economy/stock/news/stocks-drop-eighth-day-3076531,business,"Stocks in Bangladesh fell for the eighth straight trading day yesterday, triggering further panic among investors.   The DSEX, the benchmark index of the country's premier bourse, lost 12 points or 0.19 per cent to close at 6,126, the lowest since June 29 last year. It shed 240 points over the past eight sessions. The Dhaka stocks witnessed buying pressure in the morning which did not sustain at the end of the day, said International Leasing Securities in its daily market review. The selling spree of risk-averse investors continued focusing sector-specific issues amidst growing macroeconomic worries, it said. Uncertainty is still growing with the deepening of the energy crisis, rising inflation and forex market volatility, it added. Among the sectors, paper rose 1.9 per cent, cement 1 per cent and telecommunication 0.6 per cent whereas ceramics and life insurance dropped by 1.7 per cent and 1.2 per cent respectively. Investors' activities were mainly focused on the textile sector, which accounted for 17.5 per cent of the day's turnover, followed by engineering (10.1 per cent) and pharmaceuticals (8.8 per cent). Turnover, another key indicator of the market, fell to Tk 676 crore, up nearly 2 per cent from that a day ago. Of the securities traded on the day, 115 advanced, 219 fell and 47 remained unchanged. Both DS30, the blue-chip index, and DSES, the Shariah-based index, lost 5 points and 1 point respectively. S Alam Cold Rolled Steels topped the gainers' list, rising 9.90 per cent. Prime Textile Spinning Mills, Bangladesh Industrial Finance Company, New Line Clothings, and Fareast Finance and Investment also rose significantly. Asia Pacific General Insurance Company shed the most, 2 per cent. Eastern Lubricants, National Life Insurance Company, Eastern Cables, and Paper Processing & Packaging were also in the list of those suffering the highest losses. The Sonali Paper and Board Mills became the stock to be traded the most, with shares worth Tk 40 crore changing hands, followed by Robi Axiata, Beximco, KDS Accessories, and the Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company. Chittagong Stock Exchange (CSE) also witnessed erosions yesterday., The Caspi, the all-share price index of the port city bourse, plunged 62 points, or 0.34 per cent, to 17,968. At the CSE, 75 stocks advanced, 159 fell and 42 remained unchanged."
3076551,Trial run of Patenga terminal hits a snag,22-07-2022,/business/economy/news/trial-run-patenga-terminal-hits-snag-3076551,business,"The planned trial berthing of a vessel at the newly built Patenga Container Terminal (PCT) in the Chattogram port could not be begun yesterday due to the non-completion of some works.  The Chittagong Port Authority (CPA) last week announced that it would start the trial operation of the terminal by berthing a bulk vessel in one of the four jetties of the PCT, whose construction began in 2017. Some trial tests such as jetty load test, pile load test and mooring bollard load test for checking the load capacity of various parts of the jetties are yet to be carried out. CPA Chairman Rear Admiral M Shahjahan said some test trials and mechanical works need to be done before berthing a vessel. ""Otherwise, accidents might take place."" Load calibration of the weighbridge to synchronise with the entry and exit points has not been done yet. If the calibration is not completed, the authorities would be not able to perform the required verified gross mass test of container-carrying vehicles. ""We are trying to complete these works in the quickest possible time,"" said Shahjahan, adding that the trial operation might take place by the end of July. The government approved the project to construct the terminal having three container jetties and a dolphin jetty on around 32 acres of land at Patenga in June 2017. According to the initial proposal, the project was supposed to complete by December 2019. The implementation period was extended to June 2022 in the revised proposal. Speaking about the delay, Project Director and CPA Executive Engineer Mizanur Rahman said there were many challenges at the initial stage since 50 per cent area of the site was occupied by many structures of various organisations and they needed to be relocated. Owing to the coronavirus pandemic, the construction remained suspended for several months since foreign workers had left, he said, adding that more than 96 per cent of works have been completed. The original cost was estimated at Tk 1,868 crore and the terminal was supposed to be built by the CPA's funds. In the revised plan, the expenditure was reduced to Tk 1,229 crore as the government decided to execute it under the public-private partnership arrangement where the operator will procure the necessary equipment. The terminal might be formally inaugurated by September. Once the PCT becomes fully operational, the Chattogram port will be able to handle an additional five lakh twenty-foot equivalent units of containers annually. The terminal will also accommodate larger vessels with 10 metres draught. The port currently permits the berthing of vessels with up to 9.5 metres draught."
3076206,Largest loan from IMF on the cards,23-07-2022,/business/economy/news/imf-anticipating-loan-request-3076206,business,"The International Monetary Fund is expecting a formal request for a loan from Bangladesh soon to provide a buffer to the delicate foreign currency reserves amid global economic volatility even though the government remains in two minds about it. ""The authorities are expected to send a request letter to start the programme negotiation,"" said the visiting IMF mission in its concluding remarks yesterday after wrapping up its nine-day tour. The finance ministry is now awaiting the green light from the highest authority to formally approach the IMF for the loan, The Daily Star has learnt from officials involved with the proceedings. The loan amount that would be sought will be decided then, said a finance ministry official on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. Bangladesh can take up to $7 billion from the IMF as per its special drawing rights allocation, but the government would be seeking $4.5 billion. The $987 million loan taken in 2012 under the three-year Extended Credit Facility programme is the largest amount taken from the Washington-based multilateral lender as of now. Loans from the IMF typically come with tough reform plans, which often end up being too exacting to implement for many countries. The conditions that Bangladesh would be subjected to can be gauged from the mission's concluding statement. According to documents seen by The Daily Star, implementing a fuel pricing mechanism, removing the interest rate caps on lending and borrowing, resetting the methodology to report on foreign currency reserves, increasing revenue base, and strengthening corporate governance in the banking sector top the recommendations made by the mission. ""Elevated global commodity prices, growth slowdown in major trading partners and normalisation of remittance inflows suggest that the balance of payments will be under pressure in the coming years, with net reserves declining further,"" the mission said. As of July 13, Bangladesh's foreign currency reserves stood at $39.8 billion, enough to cover just about five months' import bills. In times of economic uncertainty, an import cover of 8-9 months is prescribed by multilateral lenders. The IMF is in disagreement with the Bangladesh Bank's method of calculating foreign exchange reserves, which include the riskier local investment exposure. ""Going forward, the current account balance and the exchange rate will be assessed using the External Balance Assessment methodology,"" it said, adding that an outreach mission will be planned. Given the heightened uncertainty stemming from the war in Ukraine and volatile energy, food and fertiliser prices, it would be prudent to safeguard and rebuild reserves as a buffer against shocks. The mission called for withdrawing the interest rate ceilings of 6 percent and 9 percent for deposits and loans respectively, which would help control inflation and also ease the pressure on reserves. In June, inflation hit a nine-year high of 7.56 percent. Reprioritisation of expenditures, which is much needed given the high subsidy expenditure and weak revenue collection, would also ease the pressure. Subsequently, the mission called for gradually adopting a fuel pricing mechanism in line with the global prices to bring down the subsidy expenditure on energy. This will also help accommodate additional social spending in the form of targeted aid to protect the poor. ""In the absence of adequate revenue mobilisation, budget financing is increasingly relying on costly domestic debt, eroding fiscal space."" The mission recommended reforming the expensive National Savings Certificate programme by separating it from direct budget financing. To increase revenue, which remains among the lowest in the world, a multi-pronged strategy -- including simplifying the value-added tax rate structure, modernising revenue administration and building compliance risk management capacity focusing particularly on large taxpayers -- is needed, the mission said. ""These recommendations are very pertinent to the problems facing Bangladesh at present. Regardless of where it came, these must be followed,"" said Zahid Hussain, a former lead economist of the World Bank's Dhaka office. Recommendations such as reforms in revenue policy and administration and removing the interest rate caps are international best practices, said Ahsan H Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh. ""Why does the government administer the petroleum price? Nowhere in the world would you find this. The price should follow the ebb and flow of the global market."" The interest rate cap should have never been imposed, said Mansur, also the chairman of Brac Bank. ""Nowhere in the world would you find this. Now is crunch time. Inflation is high, so the interest rates have been hiked everywhere. But in Bangladesh that scope is not there because of the interest rate cap. Is this approach reasonable and sound?"" A big portion of the imports is liquefied natural gas, petrol and fertilisers, according to Mansur, a former economist of the IMF. ""If their prices are not hiked, how would their demand go down? This is a policy failure. The government is rationing the use of electricity but where is the savings? People are using generators and charger lights and fans. Only by raising the price do you get savings. If you follow such policies, you will only face misfortune."""
3076526,Experts for making mobile tower sharing mandatory,22-07-2022,/business/economy/news/experts-making-mobile-tower-sharing-mandatory-3076526,business,"Mobile subscribers are being deprived of quality services as operators remain reluctant to share their tower infrastructure even though relevant policies have been in place for years, according to experts. Network providers are unwilling to share their cell towers, known as base transceiver stations (BTS), mainly due to their drive to stay ahead in the competition, they said. The comments came yesterday at a roundtable, styled ""Challenges in Infrastructure Sharing for the Development of Network"", organised by Telecom Reporters' Network Bangladesh (TRNB) at the BRAC Center Inn in Mohakhali, Dhaka. There are two policies regarding the sharing of network infrastructure -- the Amended Guidelines for Infrastructure Sharing, and Regulatory and Licensing Guidelines for Issuing Licence for Tower Sharing in Bangladesh -- which have been in place since 2011 and 2018 respectively. Discussants at the roundtable said making it mandatory for operators to follow both policies would ensure maximum utilisation of network facilities, opening an opportunity to save huge amounts of electricity at the same time. Besides, the quality of services would be comparatively better, they added. ""Tower sharing among operators has reached just 17 per cent over the last 25 years,"" said TIM Nurul Kabir, a telecom analyst who presented the keynote paper. ""As such, about 20,000 towers owned by operators are still not being shared,"" he added. Currently, Robi Axiata is sharing 30 per cent of its own towers, Grameenphone 18 per cent and Banglalink 17 per cent. Kabir went on to say that tower management requires large amounts of electricity, which puts pressure on the country's fuel supply. ""So, unplanned towers are having long-term effects on the environment,"" he said. Kabir added that tower sharing should not be mandatory in any standard telecommunication system but it is a must in Bangladesh considering the ongoing imbalance in the local telecom market. With this backdrop, Telecom Minister Mustafa Jabbar urged network providers to hand over their towers to BTS operators so that all of them can use these infrastructures, enabling customers to receive higher quality services. ""This would reduce the large investments telecom companies have to make in setting up such infrastructures as well,"" he said. He then advised network operators to improve their service quality unless they want to lose their market share. ""If you can't maintain the quality of service, you will suddenly fall as there is no alternative to increase the service quality,"" he added. Jabbar also said active tower sharing is essential for ensuring smooth digital services as passive sharing does not offer significant benefits in this regard. Shyam Sunder Sikder, chairman of the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC), said they are taking initiatives to speed up tower sharing. ""Mobile network operators should not only focus on expanding their business, they should also ensure better quality of service,"" he added. However, infrastructure sharing is not only limited to cell towers. ""All telecom companies should come forward in sharing their respective infrastructures, such as fibre optic cables, for ensuring optimal service quality,"" said Hossain Sadat, senior director of corporate affairs at Grameenphone. ""Under the BTRC's prudent guidance, we all need to collaborate in accelerating the sharing of our respective infrastructures to help the government realise its vision of a smart Bangladesh,"" he added. ""Grameenphone, being a tech service provider, always welcomes industry consultation towards formulating business friendly frameworks and further enhancing customer experience."" Taimur Rahman, chief corporate and regulatory affairs officer at Banglalink, said tower sharing should be immediately made compulsory for all operators, especially considering the current energy crisis. ""If we can cooperatively share infrastructure, electricity and other energy will be properly utilised,"" Rahman added. Anamika Bhakta, an executive vice president of Robi Axiata, said tower sharing could help ensure faster rolling out of services, benefiting customers greatly in the process. Rashed Mehedi, president of TRNB, and Masuduzzaman Robi, general secretary, also spoke at the event."
3076501,Russian gas flow lifts euro,22-07-2022,/business/global-economy/europe/news/russian-gas-flow-lifts-euro-3076501,business,"Stock markets eased on Thursday as a resumption of Russian gas supplies to Europe lifted the euro ahead of the European Central Bank's anticipated first interest rate hike in over a decade to quell inflation. The flow of Russian gas resumed to Germany after a 10-day outage to ease Europe's supply concerns for now, helping to ease worries about fallout on the economy. The euro edged up, distancing itself further from last week's parity against the greenback, the recovery bolstered by expectations the ECB might deliver a big 50 basis-point rate hike. Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that supplies could be reduced further or even stop, prompting the EU to tells its members to cut usage. ""European markets are going to be pulled and pushed by Putin's mood,"" said Michael Hewson, chief markets strategist at CMC Markets. Markets are looking to see how much the ECB will raise interest rates later at 1215 GMT on Thursday, with a 25-bps hike already price in, Hewson said. Traders also await details of an ECB tool to contain stress in bond markets, made all the more urgent by a crumbling government in Italy, one of the euro zone's most indebted countries. Rate hikes from the US Federal Reserve next week and from the Bank of England in August are also well anticipated by now, Hewson said. The STOXX index of 600 European companies was off 0.4 per cent. The MSCI All-Country stock index eased 0.14 per cent. Italian bonds sold off sharply following the collapse of Mario Draghi's government in the euro area's third biggest economy. Nadege Dufosse, head of cross-asset strategy at Candriam, said political turmoil in Italy is putting more pressure on the ECB to have its so-called anti-fragmentation tool in place to cap bond yields and reassure markets. ""I think they will have to deliver on that point, I think it's the main risk today. It must convince investors that it will be efficient,"" Dufosse said. After the latest series of rate hikes, investors will be trying to gauge whether the economy is headed for a soft or hard landing as higher borrowing costs are absorbed, she said. ""It's the expectations for the fourth quarter or next year that can really determine the trend in the market. For now we do not have the answer and we just have to be very pragmatic,"" Dufosse said. Bucking the trend, the Bank of Japan left monetary policy unchanged on Thursday, as expected, and raised its inflation forecasts a little bit. The yen held steady at 138.37 per dollar. Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.25 per cent and S&P 500 futures fell 0.2 per cent. Earnings from Blackstone, Dow Chemical, Philip Morris International, Twitter and American Airlines were due on Thursday. Wall Street indexes rallied overnight but even better-than-expected results from Tesla after hours couldn't carry the positive mood into the Asia session. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.1 per cent and Japan's Nikkei gained 0.4 per cent. A cloud over Chinese growth due to its strict Covid-19 controls and fresh concern over the ailing property market is also casting gloom over the prospects for global demand. Growth-sensitive commodities such as copper and iron ore have been sliding and this week Chinese banks and property stocks have been hurt by borrowers boycotting mortgage payments on unfinished homes. ""Past due mortgages doubled over the week, and ... potential home buyers are waiting for a general drop in home prices for the housing market, including completed projects,"" ING analysts said in a note to clients on Thursday. ""This is negative even for cash-rich developers.""  China's yuan was slightly firmer at 6.7664 to the dollar. Against other currencies the greenback steadied after dipping earlier in the week. The Australian dollar bought $0.68650. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield held at 3.0415 per cent, below the 2-year yield of 3.2359 per cent, a market signal that often presages a recession. Oil prices fell for a second straight session, as demand concerns outweighed tight global supply after US government data showed tepid gasoline consumption during the peak summer driving season. Brent crude was down 2.25 per cent at $104.50 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate dropped 2.6 per cent to $97.32 a barrel."
3076481,Gas crisis to cost 1.5pc of German economy: IMF,22-07-2022,/business/global-economy/news/gas-crisis-cost-15pc-german-economy-imf-3076481,business,"Halting Russian gas supplies to Germany would cost Europe's largest economy 1.5 per cent of its GDP in 2022, the International Monetary Fund said Wednesday, as concerns mount that Moscow will further squeeze supply. This year's loss would be followed by a negative impact of 2.7 per cent in 2023 and a 0.4-per cent reduction in 2024, according to an IMF forecast where gas deliveries were assumed to have stopped on June 1. A potential shutoff  ""could cause sizable reductions in German economic activity and increases in inflation"", the IMF said in a statement. Supplies to Germany from Russia are currently at zero as the Nord Stream pipeline undergoes maintenance, after Moscow initially slashed deliveries by 60 per cent in mid-June citing a delayed gas turbine repair. Berlin has rejected Gazprom's turbine explanation and believes Russia is squeezing supplies in retaliation for Western sanctions on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. Works on the pipeline are due to finish Thursday, with officials watching closely to see if and at what levels supplies resume. The risks for the economy from a complete shutdown, as well as a weak global economy and widespread supply bottlenecks  ""loom large"", the IMF said. The same headwinds meant that German  ""growth is likely to be muted in the coming quarters"", it said. In its standard forecast, the IMF sees the German economy growing by 1.2 per cent in 2022 and just 0.8 per cent in 2023. Meanwhile, the rising price of energy associated with the gas supply reductions already seen also meant that inflation is  ""likely to remain elevated in the next two years"", the IMF said. The IMF forecast inflation in Germany to sit at 7.7 per cent in 2022 and 4.8 per cent in 2023."
3076441,Ukraine pushes for debt freeze to dodge default,22-07-2022,/business/global-economy/europe/news/ukraine-pushes-debt-freeze-dodge-default-3076441,business,"Ukraine has asked its creditors for a two-year payment freeze on its international bonds in a bid to focus its dwindling financial resources on repelling Russia. Creditors have until Aug. 9 to vote on the proposal. Ukraine has called its plan a liability management exercise, indicating Kyiv's efforts to spare bondholders a writedown on the bonds. Official creditors have already said they would suspend payments owed to them and urged bondholders to accept the country's request for the freeze. The group, including Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States, said they would provide a coordinated suspension of debt servicing from August 1 to the end of 2023 and potentially for an additional year. At the end of 2020, Ukraine had $130 billion in external debt outstanding, according to World Bank data. Ukraine has earmarked nearly $20 billion in international bonds to be subject to the debt freeze - eleven dollar-denominated securities and two euro-denominated ones - maturing 2022 to 2030. Ukraine also has a warrant linked to GDP growth in the mix for an overhaul. This was created during its 2015 debt restructuring as a sweetener to creditors."
3076436,Asian cenbanks forced to play catch-up in raising rates,22-07-2022,/business/global-economy/news/asian-cenbanks-forced-play-catch-raising-rates-3076436,business,"Having bucked a global dash to tighten monetary policy for a year, Asian central banks find themselves scrambling to catch up in order to tackle rising inflation and defend weakening currencies. Market analysts suspect Indonesia, the last remaining dove in emerging Asia, may be the next to move by pushing interest rates higher on Thursday, as policymakers rush to convince investors they are tackling rising prices. Singapore and the Philippines surprised markets with unscheduled tightening announcements last week, underlining the growing urgency among policymakers to act. Asia has lagged as the rest of the world, including emerging markets, began lifting rates as early as last June, after the US Federal Reserve kicked off an accelerated timeline for its policy tightening. While relatively subdued inflation allowed central banks in Asia to remain dovish in a bid to support the post-pandemic economic recovery, that led to weakening currencies and capital outflows, even as the war in Ukraine exacerbated price pressures globally. ""Have central banks been too slow to act? Yes, I know, it's a common question,"" Ravi Menon, managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, said at a conference on Tuesday. ""And I don't want to sound defensive on behalf of my colleagues elsewhere but very few people saw this coming. The markets didn't see it. ""The climb in inflation has been quite rapid. It was unusually fast ... And many thought the bigger risks were on the downside on growth and so did not see this coming."" Currencies and bonds have borne the brunt. Among the worst hit, the Philippine peso is down more than 10 per cent year-to-date, and just off a nearly 17-year low of 56.53 per dollar. Yields on the country's government bonds have spiked about 200 basis points (bps) since the start of the year. The Thai baht has fallen more than 10 per cent this year, and Thailand snapped a five-month streak of foreign investment into equities to lose $816 million in June. A large part of the selling has been a response to rising Treasury yields and the US dollar - factors beyond domestic policymakers' control, giving Asia an excuse to hold off on rate hikes. But central banks are suddenly finding they can no longer ignore rising food and oil prices. Thailand and Indonesia saw inflation hit multi-year highs this month. Even South Korea, which began raising rates as early as August 2021, saw prices hit a 24-year high in June, triggering a record half-point rate hike last week. ""What I suspect they're doing at this stage is really (to) still focus on fighting inflation for the next few months, because that's where the concern is,"" said Euben Paracuelles, chief ASEAN economist at Nomura. He added that rising global headwinds and the risk of recession in major economies complicated the policy challenge at a time when inflation was at the start of a sharp pickup in Southeast Asia. India, which first saw its central bank raising rates by 40 bps in an off-cycle move in May, has logged six straight months of foreign investor equity outflows, contributing to a record drop in the rupee. The historically volatile Indonesian rupiah is actually only down around 5 per cent versus the dollar for the year, although it saw its largest monthly fall of 2.2 per cent in June. It has to some extent been helped by resource-rich Indonesia's improved trade position and the fact foreigners now hold less than a fifth of its high-yielding bonds."

3075536,Russia is China’s top oil supplier for 2nd month,21-07-2022,/business/global-economy/europe/news/russia-chinas-top-oil-supplier-2nd-month-3075536,business,"Russia held its spot as China's top oil supplier for a second month in June as Chinese buyers cashed in on lower-priced supplies, slashing more costly shipments from Saudi Arabia, data showed on Wednesday. Imports of Russian oil, including supplies pumped via the East Siberia Pacific Ocean pipeline and seaborne shipments from Russia's European and Far Eastern ports, totalled 7.29 million tonnes, up nearly 10 per cent from a year ago, according to data from the Chinese General Administration of Customs. Still, Russian supplies in June, equivalent to about 1.77 million barrels per day (bpd), were below May's record of close to 2 million bpd, a level analysts had expected to be maintained. China imported 5.06 million tonnes from Saudi Arabia, or 1.23 million bpd, down from 1.84 million bpd in May and 30 per cent below the level in June last year. Year-to-date imports from Russia totalled 41.3 million tonnes (1.67 million bpd), up 4 per cent on the year but still trailing behind Saudi Arabia, which supplied 43.3 million tonnes (1.75 million bpd), a volume 1 per cent below year-ago level. China's total crude oil imports sank in June to near a four-year low as rigid lockdowns to contain the spread of coronavirus reduced fuel demand. The rise in imports from Russia also displaced supplies from Angola and Brazil. The Customs data showed China imported 260,000 tonnes of Iranian crude oil last month, its fourth shipment of Iran oil since last December, confirming an earlier Reuters report. Despite US sanctions on Iran, China has kept taking Iranian oil, usually passed off as supplies from other countries. These supplies, roughly 7 per cent of China's total crude oil imports, are facing competition from the growing Russian flows. Customs reported zero imports from Venezuela."

Mbappe was the only PSG player retained in the starting line-up after Wednesday's 2-1 win over Kawasaki Frontale in Tokyo, with manager Christophe Galtier dropping star forwards Lionel Messi and Neymar to the bench. Mbappe alone was still too much for Urawa to handle, firing home a well-taken goal from a tight angle in the 35th minute. Galtier brought on Messi and Neymar for the final half an hour, but neither were able to score in front of a crowd of 61,000 in Saitama. Pablo Sarabia and Arnaud Kalimuendo got the other two goals for PSG, who play Gamba Osaka on Monday in Osaka in the final game of their tour. Galtier handed a start to Warren Zaire-Emery -- just 16 years and four months old -- alongside Marco Verratti in midfield. PSG made a sluggish start, and Yusuke Matsuo almost gave Urawa the lead after stealing past the defence in the third minute. Goalkeeper Keylor Navas tipped over a shot from Atsuki Ito just minutes later but Sarabia set PSG moving in the right direction with a stylish opener in the 16th minute. Mbappe played the ball into Mauro Icardi, who laid it off for Sarabia to lash home from just outside the box. Mbappe then made it two in the 35th minute, receiving the ball wide on the left and cutting inside before rifling the ball past the goalkeeper. Messi and Neymar came on in the 58th minute and the pair combined to set up Eric Junior Dina Ebimbe to put the ball in the net, only for the linesman to flag for offside. Kalimuendo scored PSG's third in the 76th minute, moments after Nuno Mendes had hit the post."

French World Cup winning midfielder Pogba joined Juventus this month on a free transfer after winding down his contract with Manchester United, who he joined in 216 for a then-record fee of 105 million euros. The 29-year-old made his presence felt in coach Massimiliano Allegri's starting 11 at Allegiant Stadium, home of the NFL's Las Vegas Raiders. But it was Marco Da Graca that fired Juventus ahead from close range in the 10th minute after Federico Gatti's header from a corner was parried by the Chivas goalkeeper. Mattia Compagnon added a second goal in the 80th minute after Tommaso Barbieri's solo run into the area ended with his blocked shot veering straight to his teammate. Pogba and Gatti were just two of the recent acquisitions that Allegri thrust into action, with former Real Madrid winger Angel Di Maria also in the lineup and Brazilian defender Gleison Bremer coming on amid a raft of changes for the second half. Allegri is counting on them to fill the gaps left by the departures of veteran Giorgio Chiellini, recently signed with Major League Soccer's LAFC, leading scorer Paulo Dybala in a transfer to Roma and Dutch defender Matthijs de Ligt's move to Bayern Munich. He knows fans are expecting Juventus to return to the pinnacle of Italian football, having failed to lift the trophy since winning nine titles in a row from 2011 until 2020. Last season they finished fourth, and fell to Inter Milan in the Coppa Italia Final. ""Our duty is to win this year,"" Allegri said in Vegas. ""After winning trophies 10 years in a row, last year was our first without, so we (are) obliged to win and we all know that it's an important year for us."" Juventus dominated the first half, with Di Maria, Pogba and Nicolo Fagioli all threatening. Juventus keeper Wojciech Szczesny was forced into a save on the stroke of halftime by a shot from Carlos Cisneros. After wholesale substitutions Juventus looked less cohesive in the second half, but they still managed not only to keep the Liga MX outfit in check but also to expand their lead in a promising start to a tour that includes a clash with Barcelona at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas and a meeting with Real Madrid at the Rose Bowl near Los Angeles."

The Olympic champion charged home in 50.68 seconds, slashing 0.73 off her previous mark of 51.41 set at the same springy Hayward Field last month and becoming the first woman to run under 51 seconds in the event. McLaughlin finished well clear of the Netherlands' Femke Bol (52.27) and U.S. compatriot Dalilah Muhammad (53.13). ""We knew warming up that it was going to be one of those days,"" McLaughlin said after winning her first individual World Championships title. ""I knew coming home that if I just kept my cadence and stayed on stride pattern, we could do it and it happened."" It was the sixth time in three years that the world record has been broken, after Russian Yulia Pechonkina's mark had stood for 16 years. ""The level in the 400m hurdles is certainly improving,"" said McLaughlin. ""We have a full group of girls that are willing to push our bodies to the next level and we are seeing times drop. It's really an exciting time to be in the event."" McLaughlin charged out of the blocks and by the 100 metres mark already had the lead over Muhammad, who had held the world record as recently as June 2021. McLaughlin built a comfortable gap before the back turn and finished several metres clear of Bol and Muhammad, the home crowd in Eugene, Oregon, erupting as the 22-year-old powered to the line. Bol, who took bronze in Tokyo, said McLaughlin's dominance made her question her own performance. ""She was so far in front at the end so I was always doubting if I really had a good race because it felt very good. And then I saw the sign and I was like: Wow,"" she said. ""This is just amazing and it means a lot that she also broke the 51s barrier."" Much of the hype heading into the final had focused on McLaughlin's rivalry with 2019 champion Muhammad but the 32-year-old was left disappointed after coming back from a mild hamstring injury earlier this year.  ""I'm having mixed emotions to be honest,"" she told reporters. ""I'm proud of the way we had this moment. I definitely want to keep this season going. I knew that at this race I wasn't quite at my best but I was hoping for the best."" It was the first world record broken at this year's World Championships, the first on U.S. soil, and a much-needed boost for the American women, who have excelled in the field events but had been shut out on the track. McLaughlin's accomplishment sent shockwaves through the athletics world. ""She's just special,"" Allyson Felix, the most decorated woman in track, wrote on Twitter. ""In a class of her own."" McLaughlin said she enjoyed pushing herself to new highs. ""It's very special to push boundaries for myself, focusing on the 10 hurdles and to be able to improve upon that, what else could I ask for?"" she said."

Azpilicueta, whose contract expires in June 2023, has been linked with a move to Barcelona for several months, but Tuchel said the LaLiga club's valuation of the Spain international did not match Chelsea's. ""It's a tough question because I am not sure if I want to give Azpi what he wants,"" Tuchel said. ""At some point it is about what we want. ""I made the comparison about how much we fought for Kalidou Koulibaly, who is a national team player and roughly the same age. I see [Azpilicueta] maybe at the same level but Barcelona don't see him on that level. ""I said that to him ... that I understand on a personal and a career level.

3077456,Sancho stars in Man Utd draw with Villa,23-07-2022,/sports/football/news/sancho-stars-man-utd-draw-villa-3077456,sports,"Winger Jadon Sancho continued his goal scoring form but Manchester United let slip a two-goal advantage to finish their pre-season tour of Asia and Australia with a 2-2 friendly draw against Aston Villa on Saturday. United, wearing their white away shirts, exhibited their newfound attacking flair in a dominant first half, but conceded a header to Villa's Calum Chambers in the dying seconds amid inclement conditions at Perth's Optus Stadium marked by a soggy pitch. Under new coach Erik ten Hag, United wrapped up their tour with England national player Sancho a standout to notch his third goal from four friendlies. They had earlier notched convincing victories over Liverpool, Melbourne Victory and Crystal Palace ahead of their Premier League opener against Brighton on August 7. Steven Gerrard's Villa, who finished 14th in the Premier League last season, struggled to match United's energy early before storming back into the contest to finish without a defeat in their pre-season campaign. Villa's Premier League opener is against Bournemouth on August 6. After heavy rain and thunderstorms lashed Perth earlier in the day, there were fears the game might be cancelled due to a waterlogged pitch but the contest went ahead as scheduled. Embattled skipper Harry Maguire, who copped jeering from fans in Melbourne last week reminiscent of the negative reaction he received last season, had a muted response from the near-capacity crowd of 58,228. He was in the action early with a superb header that was brilliantly saved by goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, who was under siege. The Argentine was helpless in the 24th minute when 22-year-old Sancho powerfully struck home the volley after Luke Shaw and Marcus Rashford combined well on the left side. Amid torrential rain just before half-time, Sancho continued to menace with a wicked cross smacking into Villa's Matty Cash for an own goal. Ten Hag resisted making changes at half-time, but Gerrard's decision to bring on winger Leon Bailey proved inspired with the Jamaican nailing a long-range shot to claw Villa back into the contest. The speedy Bailey threatened an equaliser against a new-look United -- after Ten Hag rang the changes in the 68th minute -- but it was Chambers who stepped up at the death."

Forty years ago, the man now fondly known as ""Uncle Percy"" escorted England batsman Chris Tavare on the pitch at the P. Sara Oval in the capital Colombo while holding a Sri Lankan flag. Now 85, he has been a regular feature since, allowed on to the field by Sri Lanka's cricket authorities to accompany the team off after every game, win or lose, still carrying his flag. And while an avid supporter of his national side, he is known for the respect with which he treats the opposition -- a far cry from the sledging employed by the fans of some teams, and even their players. Naturally, he was at Galle earlier this month when hundreds of protesters climbed the walls of the ancient fort overlooking the ground during the second Test against Australia to demand the removal of president Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The host country is suffering its worst economic crisis since independence, without the foreign exchange to pay for essentials including fuel and medicines, and leading to widespread shortages. Hours later, a furious crowd in Colombo forced the president to flee his home, and days after that he flew abroad before submitting his resignation. ""Our team's performance is better than the performance of the politicians in Sri Lanka,"" said Abeysekera. ""Not a single politician can match up to these cricketers,"" he told AFP. ""They are not politicians, they are lunatics."" ""I hate politics,"" he added. Abeysekera has twice been invited to join the Sri Lankan cricket board but declined the position. ""There are three things I don't like in the whole world, one is politics, the other one is cricket administration, and the third one is birth control,"" he said. His grandsons are named Garfield after the West Indies' Sobers, the first batsman to hit six sixes in a first-class over, and Sachinka for Indian batting great Sachin Tendulkar. 'Honour the loser' 
Cricket has offered Sri Lankans a welcome distraction from their country's travails, with a 3-2 one-day series win over Australia followed by a 1-1 Test series draw.
Pakistan are currently touring the Indian Ocean island, with the hosts looking to bounce back on Sunday from a defeat in the first Test in Galle.
Abeysekera has worked for 59 years for a cable company, and friends and family take care of his accommodation at different venues.
He took a bus from Colombo to Galle to attend the current series of games but is having to walk to the stadium with no tuk-tuks available.
""Never have I seen such a crisis,"" he said.
""I saw the world war, I saw the tsunami, I saw the LTTE attacks,"" he added, referring to the Tamil Tigers who fought a separatist war for decades.
""This is something else, but I somehow manage to come to the ground.""
As a boy, Abeysekera saw Don Bradman play at the Colombo Oval in 1948, and nearly half a century later watched Sri Lanka defeat Australia in Lahore to win the 50-over World Cup, one of his lifetime cricketing highlights.
Abeysekera's affable demeanour has won him the affection of even his beloved team's opponents.
Former New Zealand captain Martin Crowe once handed him his man-of-the-match award and he was embraced by Virat Kohli during India's tour to Sri Lanka in 2015 and even invited into the visitors' dressing room.
""For when the One Great Scorer comes to mark against your name, He writes not that you won or lost, but how you played the game,"" he says, quoting the American sportswriter Grantland Rice.
""Play fair, cheer the victor and honour the loser.""

Financial details were not disclosed but Sky Sports said Arsenal would pay 30 million pounds ($36.05 million) up front with two million pounds in add-ons for the 25-year-old defender. Zinchenko played more than 100 games in all competitions for City and helped them win four Premier League titles, four League Cups and one FA Cup. Primarily a midfielder when on international duty, Zinchenko was often deployed as a left back by Pep Guardiola at City. But he found playing time hard to come by with Joao Cancelo the preferred option on the left side of defence. ""Alex is a high-quality player who will give us options and versatility. It's not only about the positions he can play but as well, the versatility he will give us in attack and defence,"" Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said. Zinchenko will be reunited with Arteta at Arsenal, with the pair having worked together at City when Arteta was the assistant to Guardiola.
""This is a boyhood dream come true because I was a massive fan when I was a kid,"" Zinchenko said.

Stand-in captain Shikhar Dhawan's 97 was the foundation of his side's total of 308 for seven which appeared to be more than enough at the halfway stage given that the hosts were just coming off a 3-0 drubbing at the hands of Bangladesh in Guyana a week earlier. However, opener Kyle Mayers set the tone for the Caribbean side's chase with a top-score of 75 and with the rest of the batting order making important contributions the West Indies reached the final over needing 15 runs for victory. Romario Shepherd, playing only because former captain Jason Holder was ruled out with Covid 19 in the morning, and Akeal Hosein managed to scramble 11 against the bowling of seamer Mohammed Siraj as they finished agonisingly short at 305 for six. Dhawan's innings off 99 balls with three sixes and ten fours earned him the ""Man of the Match"" award although the left-handed opener was not too pleased with his team's effort in the field. ""We had a few nerves obviously towards the end of the match and maybe we didn't stick to our plans as well as we should have because if we had done so, especially with a few runs given away on the leg-side, the game would have been over as a contest earlier,"" Dhawan said after the match. Put in on a sweltering morning, he saw opening partner Shubman Gill (64) play most of the shots early on in a stand of 119 off 18 overs. Shreyas Iyer stroked his way to 54 before becoming the second wicket for Gudakesh Motie. Motie had earlier dismissed Dhawan via an excellent diving catch by Shamarh Brooks at backward-point as India lost momentum when ominously poised at 213 for one in the 34th over. Motie and fellow left-arm spinner Hosein were the most economical of the West Indies bowlers although pacer Alzarri Joseph bolstered the home side's rearguard in the field with two important wickets. ""It's a bittersweet feeling,"" was West Indies captain Nicholas Pooran's summary of the match. ""We've been talking about batting 50 overs and we did it this time but came up short. ""Still, we really competed well against one of the best teams in the world and we need to keep on improving against this type of opposition if we want to get our ODI cricket back on track."""
3077241,England bounce back to hammer South Africa,23-07-2022,/sports/cricket/news/england-bounce-back-hammer-south-africa-3077241,sports,"The returning Reece Topley sparked a dramatic collapse as England hammered South Africa by 118 runs in the second one-day international at Old Trafford on Friday to level the three-match series at 1-1. South Africa, chasing 202 for victory in a match reduced by rain to 29 overs per side, were bowled out for just 83. Topley, whose career has been stalled by several stress fractures, sparked a top-order slump to 27-5 during a spell of 2-17 in four overs. Spinners Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali shared five wickets between them as South Africa were dismissed with nearly nine overs remaining for their equal second-lowest completed ODI total, behind a 69 all out against Australia at Sydney in 1993 and level with an 83 against England at Nottingham in 2008. ""It feels great, it's great for us to get the win,"" said England captain Jos Buttler. ""The guys are bowling brilliantly. Topley coming back in and getting early wickets, Dave (Willey) doing the same."" The in-form Topley, rested from England's 62-run defeat in the first ODI at Durham on Tuesday, removed Janneman Malan and Rassie van der Dussen for ducks just three days after they had scored a fifty and a hundred respectively. Malan chipped to mid-on attempting to flick one off his pads and Van der Dussen feathered a thin edge through to wicketkeeper and England captain Jos Buttler. Willey, like Topley a left-arm quick, had the dangerous Quinton de Kock chipping to cover. And South Africa were 6-4 when Aiden Markram was run out without facing a ball by Buttler. Sam Curran, another left-arm seamer, then bowled David Miller for 12 to leave the Proteas 27-5 inside nine overs. And there was no way back from there for the Proteas against 50-over world champions England, for all that Heinrich Klassen made 33 -- one of just three double-figure scores in the innings -- against a disciplined England attack. Pretorius strikes  Earlier, Dwaine Pretorius marked his return to South Africa duty by taking four wickets as England were dismissed for 201. Pretorius finished with career-best figures of 4-36, including removing star batsmen Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow in the space of three balls. Left-arm wrist-spinner Tabraiz Shamsi (2-39) and fast bowler Anrich Nortje (2-53) took two wickets apiece. Only all-rounders Liam Livingstone (38) and Sam Curran (35) managed more than 30 for England, with Willey adding a useful run-a-ball 21 late on before he became Pretorius's fourth wicket. But, as it turned out, England had more than enough runs to play with as they levelled the series ahead of Sunday's decider in Leeds. ""I thought that it was a score that could be chased on that wicket,"" said South Africa captain Keshav Maharaj. ""We just didn't adapt well enough with the bat, there were a lot of soft wickets and when you lose four wickets in the powerplay it's hard to adapt."" England, sent into bat by Maharaj, slumped to 62-4 inside nine overs.

3077041,Sohan captain for Zim T20Is,23-07-2022,/sports/cricket/news/sohan-captain-zim-t20is-3077041,sports,"The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) yesterday named 28-year-old wicketkeeper-batter Nurul Hasan Sohan captain for the T20I series in Zimbabwe after deciding to rest regular skipper Mahmudullah Riyad for the T20Is. With Shakib Al Hasan having already been granted a break from the T20 series, the BCB also confirmed that two other seniors, Riyad and Mushfiqur Rahim, would be rested for the T20 series. Rumours had been rife that members of the team management would sit with Riyad yesterday afternoon and cricket operations chairman Jalal Yunus, team director Khaled Mahmud and all three selectors briefed the media following that meeting, which was slated to shed light on the immediate future of Riyad's T20I captaincy. ""We had a lot to think about in regards to T20s and we had been in discussion about the T20 team for a while since we have not been able to improve in the Test and T20 formats. Since Riyad was the T20 captain, we had been discussing his captaincy issue,"" Jalal told the media yesterday. ""We held discussions with Riyad and told him that we wanted to send a new team to Zimbabwe. A few seniors won't be there so we wanted to have a look at new players. We named Nurul Hasan to lead the side and informed Mahmudullah. We also notified Shakib and Mushfiqur that we were going to try some new players in their place."" Newly-appointed skipper Nurul said that his vision would be to get the team to play as a unit. ""Obviously it is a big challenge, but I am up for it. I will try to keep the team together and make sure we play as a unit. I have some experience of captaining in the Dhaka Premier League, but obviously an international assignment as captain is a big challenge,"" Nurul, who had a good series with the bat in the West Indies following match-winning knocks in the DPL for Sheikh Jamal, told The Daily Star yesterday. Nurul will be captain only for the Zimbabwe T20Is, team director Mahmud told the media. There had been rumours that Mahmudullah would be stripped of captaincy after the West Indies series and sources inside the BCB had previously informed that Shakib would be handed the T20 captaincy following the Zimbabwe series. ""It's not like Riyad will not return. Everyone needs a break at times, but we will decide on that later. It's just about creating opportunities for young players,"" Mahmud informed. While the BCB said that Riyad and Mushfiqur had been rested, both have been included in the Zimbabwe ODIs slated to commence from August 5 after the completion of the T20Is on August 2. Thus, question marks arose over both seniors' T20I careers with the BCB looking to refurbish the team in the shortest format. While Riyad could not be reached for comment, he took the decision positively, according to Khaled Mahmud. Pacer Hasan Mahmud has been included for both formats in Zimbabwe while batter Parvez Hossain was called into the T20I squad."

Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) higher-ups, including cricket operations chairman Jalal Yunus and team director Khaled Mahmud and the three selectors, sat for a meeting at a city hotel yesterday after which they announced wicketkeeper-batter Nurul Hasan Sohan as captain for T20I series against Zimbabwe. The Tigers' performance in the shortest format under regular T20I skipper Mahmudullah has remained disappointing, with the latest series against the West Indies ending in a 3-0 whitewash, prompting selectors to look towards the future and form a young T20I side. Selectors also decided to rest senior players in the form of skipper Mahmudullah Riyad and Mushfiqur Rahim for the T20Is. ""We can't say that we are experimenting with the team since we are not doing well in the T20 format. So the idea is to try a few new players and see how they perform. We have seen how Bangladesh play with Mahmudullah, Shakib and Mushfiqur. So the intention behind including new faces is to allow them to play freely,"" Mahmud told the media yesterday. Emon burst onto the scene during the Bangabandhu T20 Cup in 2020 when he became the youngest Bangladeshi to score a hundred in the T20 format, registering the feat for Fortune Barishal off just 42 balls. The left-handed opener was included in the T20I side last year for the third and final T20I against Pakistan but did not make his debut. Young pacer Mahmud, who made his T20I debut in 2020 but has been dealing with injuries since, also made a comeback to the T20I and ODI side. According to chief selector Minhajul Abedin Nannu, the youngster has been in good touch recently and selectors were willing to observe him keeping the upcoming Asia Cup and World Cup in mind. ""We know we are not being able to perform in the T20 format. But, with an eye on the Asia Cup and T20 World Cup, we are trying to see a few new players in the Zimbabwe series. So we decided to rest some senior players,"" Minhajul said. ""Emon is a young player and has been nursed in the High Performance side. So far, we have got positive feedback about him. He even scored a century just a couple of days back and I think he is in very good shape."" Unlike Shakib Al Hasan, who had already asked for a break from the Zimbabwe tour, other seniors like Mahmudullah and Mushfiqur will feature in the three-match ODI series in Zimbabwe. Meanwhile, wicketkeeper-batter Anamul Haque was also retained for both the T20I and ODI sides for the upcoming tour. There was also speculation about Najmul Hossain's place given his poor form in the West Indies, but the left-hander also made it to the limited-overs teams in Zimbabwe. Bangladesh are schedule to travel Zimbabwe on July 26. They will begin their African safari with the first of the three T20Is on July 30 in Harare."

3077281,Ronaldo in limbo as elite clubs not interested to sign him,23-07-2022,/sports/football/news/ronaldo-limbo-elite-clubs-not-interested-sign-him-3077281,sports,"Cristiano Ronaldo faces an uncertain future after the Manchester United striker's attempt to force his way out of Old Trafford failed to spark the expected rush for his signature. The Portugal superstar shocked United earlier this month with his bombshell exit request after the team's failure to qualify for the Champions League. Ronaldo would have anticipated a host of top clubs jostling to sign him. But for the first time in his glittering career he is no longer a must-have item for Europe's wealthy elite as Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain all appear to have turned their backs on the forward. Concerns over Ronaldo's declining work-rate and his notoriously demanding personality have left the 37-year-old in limbo. Chelsea co-owner Todd Boehly was reported to have spoken to Ronaldo's agent Jorge Mendes about a deal to mark the new era at Stamford Bridge. But Blues boss Thomas Tuchel is believed to have concerns about trying to integrate Ronaldo into his plans for a fluid front three after signing Raheem Sterling from Manchester City. ""We focused on our top target Raheem Sterling who we signed and everything else stays behind closed doors,"" Tuchel said when asked about Ronaldo. Selling Robert Lewandowski to Barcelona could have created space for Ronaldo at Bayern, but the German champions' CEO Oliver Kahn poured cold water on that idea. ""As highly as I rate Cristiano Ronaldo as one of the greatest, a transfer wouldn't be a fit with our philosophy,"" he said. ""I love Cristiano Ronaldo and everyone knows how fantastic he is. But every club has a certain philosophy and I'm not sure if it would be the right thing for Bayern and the Bundesliga if we signed him now."" United manager Erik ten Hag has repeatedly stated the club's public position that Ronaldo is ""not for sale"". Yet, although Ronaldo finished as United's top scorer last season, there is a growing sense in Manchester that his departure could benefit Ten Hag's chances of building a side more suited to the style he created at Ajax. United have flourished without Ronaldo on a pre-season tour of Asia and Australia, scoring 11 goals in victories over Liverpool, Melbourne Victory and Crystal Palace. Dwindling options A dynamic front three of Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Jadon Sancho has shown what they are capable of. All three of those players struggled last season after Ronaldo's arrival changed the style of a United side that had finished second in the Premier League the season before. Ronaldo's time at Juventus also coincided with a decline in European results for the Italian giants, despite his goalscoring record of 101 goals in 134 games. After witnessing two European giants struggle to accommodate the ageing five-time Ballon d'Or winner, there are few takers for the veteran goal-scorer. Ronaldo's iconic status at United, established in his trophy-laden first spell with the club, has also lost some of its lustre. Andy Mitten, journalist and editor of the United We Stand fanzine, said: ""His arrival was sprung on United at the last minute and the team which had finished third and second had to rip up their tactics and start again. ""They don't see Ronaldo as United's future and there are plenty of fans who'd go along with that."" United's rivals Manchester City, who won the race for Borussia Dortmund's Erling Haaland, and Liverpool, who spent a fee that could rise to 100 million euros ($102 million) on Benfica's Darwin Nunez, both opted to sign younger forwards just entering their prime. A return to Real Madrid, where Ronaldo starred from 2009 to 2018, seems unlikely given Karim Benzema's brilliant displays in their Champions League and La Liga-winning campaign last season. Even PSG, habitual collectors of football's marquee names, seem to be out of the running. A switch to Real's rivals Atletico Madrid remains a possibility, but with his options dwindling, Ronaldo may have to swallow his pride and stay at Old Trafford. If that is too much for his ego to take, one last payday in the United States or Saudi Arabia could loom as definitive evidence of Ronaldo's decline."

The Catalan giants had already sold 10 percent of their league TV rights to the same group last week for 207.5 million euros ($215 million). ""In total, Sixth Street will receive 25 percent of the La Liga club's television rights for the next 25 years,"" Barca said in a statement. The club did not say how much they had been paid for the extra 15 percent, but Spanish press reports put the amount at around 400 million euros. The agreement will help the five-time European champions continue to make new signings for next season after the arrivals of Robert Lewandowski and Raphinha. Barcelona have been desperately trying to raise capital after struggling financially in recent years. Last August, Joan Laporta, who returned as Barcelona president the previous November, said an audit had uncovered total club debts of 1.35 billion euros. The club let Lionel Messi leave last June, saying they could not afford to keep him even at a reduced salary."
3076691,Ten Hag tells Maguire to win over critics,22-07-2022,/sports/football/news/ten-hag-tells-maguire-win-over-critics-3076691,sports,"New Manchester United coach Erik ten Hag told skipper Harry Maguire on Friday that it is up to him to win over the fans by performing better. The Dutchman also said that he is still in the market for new players and needs ""more options"", with United chasing Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong. Ten Hag has stamped his mark on United during the pre-season tour of Asia and Australia, but kept Maguire as captain despite the England centre-back struggling last year and being booed by fans. The jeering has followed the 29-year-old to Australia, where Maguire was targeted by a smattering of fans in their 3-1 victory over Crystal Palace in Melbourne. ""We heard,"" Ten Hag told reporters in Perth ahead of United's friendly against Aston Villa on Saturday. ""But you see, if you perform, it slows down. It's about how can we change it. ""The team and Harry can by performing, and that is the only focus."" United have impressed in their first games under disciplinarian Ten Hag with convincing friendly victories over Liverpool, Melbourne Victory and Palace. Their attacking play, hallmarks of Ajax during Ten Hag's reign, has led to renewed confidence ahead of the new Premier League season following their disappointing sixth-placed finish last season. The Red Devils appear set to start the campaign without Cristiano Ronaldo, who hasn't reported back for pre-season after asking to leave Old Trafford. He is missing the tour due to ""a family issue"". ""Of course. But concerning is maybe not the right word,"" Ten Hag said when asked if he was concerned about Ronaldo's absence. ""I focus on the players who are there, they are doing really well, they are in good shape. ""I prefer to focus on that and develop that. I cannot wait for him to come in, then we will integrate him."" As the Ronaldo drama plays out in the background, United are intent on strengthening their squad before the transfer window closes on September 1. United have signed left-back Tyrell Malacia, centre-back Lisandro Martinez and playmaker Christian Eriksen but appear in need of a central midfielder and forward. ""We signed Eriksen for the midfield department, so we are really happy with that,"" Ten Hag said. ""We need more options where you have a good team, and it's not only about the team, you need a good squad to get the right results at the end of the season. ""So we have to strengthen the squad even more and we are looking around, but we also need the right players."""

The gaudy gambling captial in the Nevada desert is more commonly associated with hosting blockbuster heavyweight boxing contests than clashes between members of European football's aristocracy. But for one night at least, just a stone's throw from the shimmering neon lights of the Vegas Strip, the beautiful game will take top billing as Barca and Real face off at the 65,000-capacity Allegiant Stadium, home of the Las Vegas Raiders NFL team. The friendly looks set to provide a taste of what the next chapter of Barcelona and Real Madrid's rivalry may look like. With the likes of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo long gone from Barcelona and Real respectively, a slew of new signings will be in the spotlight when the two teams take to the field for a game that kicks off at 8pm local time (0300 GMT Sunday). The friendly could mark the first Clasico confrontation between Real's veteran French star Karim Benzema and Barcelona's new attacking recruit Robert Lewandowski. Benzema has joined up with Real in Los Angeles this week after being granted an extended vacation by the club. Benzema's talismanic performances -- and goals -- were largely responsible for helping Real win a record 14th European Champions League crown in May. Although earlier reports suggested Benzema would play no part in Saturday's Clasico, manager Carlo Ancelotti picked the striker to lead the line in a practice game at the UCLA Campus on Thursday, alongside Federico Valverde and Brazilian star Vinicius. Ancelotti is also likely to give a run-out to new signings Antonio Rudiger, who joined from English club Chelsea, and former Monaco midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni. ""The signings bring great quality to the squad,"" Ancelotti said this week. ""They are in the best we could find on the market. Rudiger is a great centre-back and Tchouameni is great, very young and has a lot of potential."" 'Never an exhibition' Ancelotti has hinted that he may use Real's three-game US tour as an opportunity to experiment with his forward line, citing the unusual mid-season disruption that will come this year due to the first ever World Cup being held in the middle of the European football calendar. ""Benzema is first choice but we have to understand that it will be a strange season, with the World Cup in between and we have to look at different options,"" Ancelotti said. One of those options may involve deploying Eden Hazard as a false nine, Ancelotti said. While many pre-season games often have the feel of glorified practice games, Ancelotti insisted that the mutual antipathy between Real and Barcelona ensured that Saturday's clash would have an edge. ""It will be a very, very competitive match. It is never an exhibition against Barcelona. It will be a spectacle,"" Ancelotti said. Ancelotti's Barcelona counterpart, Xavi Hernandez, will also have the chance to run the rule over the club's summer signings. Bayern Munich sharpshooter Lewandowski is the club's marquee acquistion, but Barcelona have also invested heavily to bring in Brazilian forward Raphina from Leeds as well as midfielder Franck Kessie from AC Milan and defender Andreas Christensen from Chelsea. Lewandowski was unveiled by Barcelona on Wednesday but did not play in the previous night's 6-0 thrashing of Inter Miami. The Polish star is desperate to get to work though with his new teammates and could be set for a Clasico debut on Saturday. ""I am always hungry to succeed and have the winning mentality,"" Lewandowski said this week. ""This is a new challenge for me and I have already seen this is a squad with huge potential. ""There is a lot of quality and I want to do my best for the club. I am ready."""

Liverpool, who won the FA Cup and League Cup titles last season but finished as runners-up in the Premier League and Champions League, face Manchester City in the Community Shield curtain-raiser next weekend.

It was the second successive continental player of the year award for Mane after the coronavirus pandemic forced the cancellation of the last two editions.
He won ahead of former Liverpool teammate Mohamed Salah from Egypt and fellow Senegal international and Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy.
Mane and Salah played pivotal roles last season with Liverpool, who lifted the FA Cup and English League Cup and finished runners-up in the Premier League and Champions League.
Salah has since signed a new contract at Anfield while Mane opted for a move, with Bayern reportedly paying an initial 32 million euros ($32.5 million) that could rise to 41 million euros.
The transfer fee was a far cry from the four million euros Red Bull Salzburg paid Metz in 2012 when Mane made his first move in Europe.
Decisive penalties 
In February, Mane converted the decisive fifth penalty to give Senegal a 4-2 shootout victory over Egypt and a first Africa Cup of Nations title after the final ended 0-0 in Yaounde.
A month later, Mane was once again the shootout match-winner against Egypt, this time in a World Cup play-off near Dakar after a 1-1 aggregate stalemate.
Salah did not get a chance to take a penalty in the Cup of Nations decider while he blazed the first Egyptian kick wide in the play-off that secured a World Cup place in Qatar this November for Senegal.
Born in a village nearly 400 kilometres (250 miles) from Dakar, Mane attracted the attention of Metz having played for local second-tier club Generation Foot.
After enhancing his reputation at Salzburg, Mane joined Southampton, where his feats included scoring a record-breaking 176-second Premier League hat-trick against Aston Villa.
In mid-2016 the Senegalese signed for Liverpool and went on to form a fearsome front three with Salah and Brazilian Roberto Firmino.
As Mane moved to Bayern, Liverpool manager said Jurgen Klopp said: ""My only criticism of Sadio is that maybe at times he is the only one not to realise just how good he is.""

3076511,West Germany's iconic 1966 captain Uwe Seeler passes away,22-07-2022,/sports/football/news/west-germanys-iconic-1966-captain-uwe-seeler-passes-away-3076511,sports,"Uwe Seeler, one of the iconic figures of post-war German football and who skippered West Germany in the 1966 World Cup final, has died at the age of 85, officials said Thursday. ""Hamburg mourns Uwe Seeler. He was the first top scorer in the Bundesliga. He has now died surrounded by his loved ones,"" said a statement by the municipality of Hamburg, the city where he spent his club career. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also commented on Twitter: ""He was a role model for many, we will miss him,"" he said. Seeler, who was born in 1936, made his debut for Hamburg in 1953 and went on to make 476 appearances before his retirement in 1972. He was later club president but resigned in 1998 because of a financial scandal in which he was not implicated. Seeler played a total of 72 matches for West Germany between 1954 to 1970, scoring 33 goals but never won a World Cup. He was, however, the major architect of the reconstruction of German football after the Second World War, which went hand in hand with the reconstruction of the country. Fourth in the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, and beaten in the quarter-finals in 1962, Seeler's finest moment was captaining the West Germany team that reached the 1966 final at Wembley, albeit losing 4-2 to hosts England after extra-time. It remains arguably the most famous World Cup final ever because of the controversy which still rumbles on over whether Geoff Hurst's goal to put England 3-2 up actually crossed the line. Hurst's shot beat goalkeeper Hans Tilkowski, the ball hit the underside of the crossbar, bounced on the line before being headed away by defender Wolfgang Weber."

3076916,Amla: A swimmers’ village without a swimming pool,23-07-2022,/sports/more-sports/news/amla-swimmers-village-without-swimming-pool-3076916,sports,"Amla is a small and tranquil village, akin to many other villages in the country, situated twenty-two kilometres away from the south-western Kushtia district. The place is, however, not unfamiliar to those who happen to follow Bangladesh swimming as the village is known as a 'Sataru village' (the village of swimmers). It's quite incredible how this village kept producing numerous swimmers for the last 35 years -- who have earned fame in both national and international levels, and especially taking into account the successes which materialised without any modern facilities, or any proper ones for that matter. From Rubel Rana, the gold medallist in the 2004 SAFF Games, to Bangladesh swimming's new crown Jewel Ahmed to country's famous swimmer Sabura Khatun, their swimming venture originated from this remote village. ""Under the banner of Kushtia DSA (District Sports Association), the swimmers from Amla first participated in the national junior swimming championships in 1987 and Shahjalal won a bronze and that was the lone success. Afterwards, many swimmers from here achieved laurels. The journey is still ongoing but the most pathetic fact is the swimmers here keep practicing in available water bodies,"" said Amirul. ""Under the banner of Kushtia DSA (District Sports Association), the swimmers from Amla first participated in the national junior swimming championships in 1987 and Shahjalal won a bronze and that was the lone success. Afterwards, many swimmers from here achieved laurels. The journey is still ongoing but the most pathetic fact is the swimmers here keep practicing in available water bodies,"" said Amirul. Thus invariably, when it comes to any national competition, the swimmers from Amla always make the headlines. But what makes it possible for the swimmers in this famous village to shine amid the non-existent infra-structure? In 2017, a swimming pool was established in Kushtia town and unfortunately it lies almost unused. Amirul Islam, who initiated the swimming training at Amla around 1985 with 10-12 learners, projected the bleak scenario surrounding Amla. ""Under the banner of Kushtia DSA (District Sports Association), the swimmers from Amla first participated in the national junior swimming championships in 1987 and Shahjalal won a bronze and that was the lone success. Afterwards, many swimmers from here achieved laurels. The journey is still ongoing but the most pathetic fact is the swimmers here keep practicing in available water bodies,"" said Amirul. ''The first pond I used to train the swimmers is no longer in existence. The pond at the Amla Govt College we used was also filled up. I'm training the budding swimmers at a BADC pond, which is two kilometres away from Amla, while one of my former students named Kamal is also preparing another group of swimmers at GK project canal, which also happens to be one-and-half kilometre away from our village. ""One information is enough to help you understand what kind of boys and girls train here, that they have no financial ability to visit Kushtia to avail the training facilities there by spending Tk 100,"" Amirul continued. ""Some six to seven thousand boys and girls trained here so far and went on to participate in domestic competitions. Meanwhile, at least twenty-five swimmers took part in different international competitions and grabbed the medals from gold to bronze but here we are, still crying and pleading for optimum facilities for so long,"" said the dejected former swimmer, who failed to make his career successful as a swimmer but his dream somehow came true through his students. Despite all hurdles, the swimming took a great stride in this village because of the interest of local people, who have continued to encourage their boys and girls to become swimmers to this very day.  ""They [locals] are my great inspiration and without their enthusiasm we cannot run it here,"" said Amirul. Amirul further informed about six to seven more clubs that are toiling hard to produce good swimmers and apart from Amirul, coaches like Kamal Hossain, Morjina Khatun, Emdadul Haque and Anwar Hossain are tirelessly involved in coaching in canals or abandoned ponds in Amla. But why do people of this locality encourage their children to take swimming as a profession? Is it all about passion or do other factors exist? Many consider the sustained success of swimmers here at national and international level has inspired others to take swimming as a profession. ""There is the issue of making a career through swimming. Here people are not well off and they know success in swimming can bring a job for their boy or girl in service teams,"" said Amirul, who is currently a coach of Bangladesh Ansar-VDP swimming team.  ""Many teenagers from this area are doing well at the national and international level as well as being engaged in good jobs in the swimming teams of Army, Navy, Ansar-VDP and Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation (BJMC). For this reason, many parents remain enthusiastic regarding swimming,"" he added. ""There is a job issue behind our desire to become a swimmer. And it's one of the reasons I want to take up swimming as a career,"" said an aspirant swimmer Amal Hussain, a secondary school student. ""If you know how to swim well, there is a possibility of getting a good job at a very young age. That's why I wanted to encourage my 14-year-old girl in swimming,"" said Harunur Rashid Askari, a parent of a swimmer. The participation of the girls is another key facet of this village's remarkable journey in swimming. Morjina Khatun, who has already gained fame in swimming and a coach at present, said: ""Many female swimmers are contributing at the national and international level by taking swimming training in adverse conditions here. Therefore, it will be good to have a swimming pool in Amla.""  Another renowned swimmer Sabura Khatun, who has won more than a hundred medals in swimming, said: ""If there was patronage, extraordinary success stories would have been created from here."" Sabura is currently working in Bangladesh Army as a coach. On the other hand, Babita Khatun and Chameli Akhtar are serving in Ansar-VDP after showing achievements in swimming while Najma Khatun, Seema Khatun, Subarna Khatun and Lucky Akter are serving in the Navy. And upon seeing their accomplishments, dreamy-eyed girls and young women are also venturing into the sport. Devoid of facilities, Amla had always stood on a slippery slope and conditions there have inevitably declined. ""The time has changed and you have to provide minimum facilities if you want to produce quality swimmers. Once known as a good hub of swimmers, the number of participants in recent years is far from encouraging,"" said Amirul, who once served as the joint general secretary of the Bangladesh Swimming Federation. ""True we have young talent like Amy Akhter and Mukta Akhter who hogged the spotlight in the junior levels but still the overall picture is gloomy considering the glorious past."" From young swimmers to the coaches, everybody was crying for public or private initiatives to build on their successes. The only good news for swimmers in Amla so far is that they are going to get a 50-meter pool with some facilities in their locality. ""One day our Mirpur upazila chairman Kamarul Areefin told me that he once heard the name of Amla of Kushtia regularly but now-a-days we hear the name of Kishoreganj in swimming."" informed Amirul. ""In reply, I told him the locals of Kishoreganj are helping their budding swimmers to groom up but here you are the only person who is going to help us by building up a 50-meter pool at the Amla High School premises. I promised him that we would regain our glory in junior swimming competitions within the next two years. To be honest, no one except the chairman of Mirpur upazila is taking care of Amla swimmers."" From Sabura Khatun to the young swimmers, everybody holds the opinion that without modern facilities, one cannot excel in national competition or international events these days. Hence the patronage from private and government authorities is a must.   Despite the gloom, Amirul remains an extremely optimistic man and sees the silver lining. ""You know, swimming has entered into the psyche of the local people. From here it is possible to build a better generation of swimmers if a swimming pool with better facilities can be built."""

Jewel Ahmed, a 35-time gold medalist swimmer at the national level, is one such athlete who also hails from this village. In an interview with The Daily Star's Ashfaq Ul Mushfiq, Jewel shared his experiences in Amla and talked about the things that need to be done to improve the scenario of his village. The Daily Star (DS): Tell us about the early stages of your career. Jewel Ahmed (JA): I started swimming back in 2003. Initially, I didn't know much about the rules of swimming. So, when I took part in my first competition, I just had this excitement of going to Dhaka. I went there with my coach, participated in the competition and came back home. But later when I realised there is an uproar around those who win medals, I said to myself that I have to win as well. So that's how my journey in swimming started and I won my first age-level (8 to 10 years) gold in 2008. DS: What is the process of becoming a professional swimmer from places like Amla? JA: Back in our days, there was a good tradition of swimming in Amla. We had two swimming clubs. Later on, Bangladesh Ansar also came to Amla and swimmers from different parts of the country gathered there and chose their preferred clubs for training. To get into the service teams, swimmers need to beat a standard time and only the ones who can do that get selected. DS: How do the swimmers get into academies in Amla? JA: Everyone comes here of their own will. My story was that when I got interested in swimming, I went to Amla and talked to the coaches and expressed my interest to be a swimmer. And when they saw my eagerness to learn and swim, they told me to come regularly. DS: Were there any admission or monthly fees involved? JA: No, to this day, no swimmers have had to pay a single penny to train in Amla. All the coaches there train swimmers voluntarily. DS: How was the training routine for swimmers in Amla? JA: We always trained according to the routine. Usually, in the morning, we trained from 6 to 8 or 9 and from 4 to 6 in the evening. DS: Amla used to produce a lot of talented swimmers who would go on to win medals in international events. But it is said that things are not like how it used to be. What's your thought about this? JA: The main asset for a swimmer is a swimming pool which is yet to be established in Amla. I used to train in the ponds of Amla Government Degree College. With the help of our coaches, we used bamboo sticks to somehow make walls for swimmers in the pond and continued training like that. We demanded for a swimming pool in Amla for a long time. But the problem was that only orders were given but no sign of implementation. If you have talented swimmers but don't have a swimming pool, things don't work like that. I started swimming back in 2003. Initially, I didn't know much about the rules of swimming. So, when I took part in my first competition, I just had this excitement of going to Dhaka. I went there with my coach, participated in the competition and came back home. But later when I realised there is an uproar around those who win medals, I said to myself that I have to win as well.

DS: What do you think needs to be done to improve such a scenario? JA: As I've said, a swimming pool is a must. And a proper club is needed which will not only maintain the swimming pool but conduct swimming activities. They should hire a coach who will select prospects and train them on a regular basis. In Amla, currently, there are two swimming teams but they don't have a single place to train as the swimmers have been forbidden to train in the ponds of Amla Degree College since 2016. So the local swimmers are now training anywhere they find water bodies. There is no measurement, nobody to check the time, and no proper facilities for swimming."

""Politics is not a conversation I enjoy.""Ganga Senavirathne, 19-year-old swimmer from Sri Lanka.
Local sports federations have been bled dry by Sri Lanka's financial crash, leaving athletes in doubt in recent weeks over whether they would be able to compete at all.



""Sport has been our lives, it would have been a big, big disappointment,"" said Karunaratne, a three-time Olympian who has appeared at every Commonwealth Games since his debut as a teenager at Manchester in 2002.

""Fortunately the sports ministry and the national cricket board did a great, great job to somehow find the funds,"" the 37-year-old told AFP.
Sri Lanka has weathered months of food and fuel shortages, blackouts and runaway inflation in the wake of its worst financial crash on record.



Public anger over the downturn this month saw a huge crowd storm the home and office of the country's president, who then fled abroad and resigned.
Sports federations were hit hard by the crisis after already seeing their coffers drained during the coronavirus pandemic, which obliterated athletic sponsorships from local businesses.
Federations were left without enough cash to pay for athlete uniforms and plane tickets at a time when a post-pandemic travel bounce has driven up the cost of airfares.
Dampath Fernando, the Sri Lankan team's chef de mission, said administrators had lobbied for support in their determination to do everything they could to give the country a chance to compete.
""As a matter of principle sport brings so many good things, so much happiness,"" Fernando told AFP.
""We want to stand like other nations, in front of our flag, as a proud nation, keeping our backs straight, our heads strong and we want to do our best.""
Commonwealth Games organisers were made aware of the Sri Lankans' financial struggles and responded with a promise to sponsor the bulk of the travelling squad.
Sri Lanka's cricket board, which recently hosted Australia despite fears political unrest would disrupt their seven-week tour of the island, chipped in more than 22 million rupees ($60,000) to help cover the remaining shortfall.
'We have a responsibility' 
Sri Lanka's worsening economy has thrown up other obstacles for the country's athletes and their determination to improve on their haul of one silver and five bronze medals at the Gold Coast in 2018.
Fuel shortages have made it difficult for some competitors to travel to practice, while budget constraints have left sport federations short of clothing and other essential equipment.
Fernando said the resilience of the athletes had made him and his colleagues determined to get the competitors to the Games, which start next Thursday.
""This is not the first time that we as a country have faced these type of battles,"" Fernando said, citing a decades-long civil war and a tsunami that killed more than 30,000 of his compatriots.
""It's a dream of athletes to take part,"" he added. ""We have a responsibility to fulfil that dream. Just because we are facing economic crisis... does not mean that we just forget about it.""
Disruptions and unrest are now part of daily life in Sri Lanka and many athletes have done their best to make do.
""Anyway, I can't control it,"" said Ganga Senavirathne, 19, a swimmer preparing for her Commonwealth Games debut.
""In terms of things I can control, like my training, I was able to manage everything pretty well,"" she told AFP.

Despite the wallet reportedly containing around £680, Neuer rewarded Hazir with just a Bayern goalkeeper's shirt for his troubles. Hazir received the shirt as his reward in the post two weeks after returning the wallet, without comment or note of thanks.  He told Sky Germany: ""This finder's fee is a mockery. I have four children. I can't do anything with the jersey."" By law in Germany, anyone returning property worth €500 is entitled to 5% of the value, and an additional 3% for property worth anything over that, meaning that Hazir was owed only €34 for his troubles. But having rushed 120km to return the wallet the driver is understandably aggrieved that he was not shown any further gratitude."

""Because I don't like a lot of people or noise, I was labeled as unsocial. As I am not interested in cooking, I was deemed to not be 'marriage material',"" elaborated Nancy. She also wrote that she was told she was not a good mother, because she would not coddle her children all the time. Nancy then went on to write, ""People have said I am incapable of love, simply because I cannot hold back my anger at times. That I am not a good wife, because I have multiple failed marriages. I only know how to sing; thus, I do not know the meaning of 'hard work'."" The artist also mentioned that she was told that she was not 'neat and clean' because she did not properly apply makeup. She also added that some people called her unsmart and uneducated because she does not speak in English all the time and because she did not attend university. ""I don't have a lot of hobbies, or even time for any hobbies as I am a mother of four children. But no one remembers the fact that I embraced motherhood at the age of 19,"" wrote the singer. She also went on to say that people had shamed her for being obese and not being able to fit into many dresses. Nancy concluded the post saying, ""Just because I am Nancy, I can no longer feel emotions, have wishes or passions. Because I am an artist, I apparently can no longer feel pain or grief. I can't dress the way I like, can't live my life on my terms, or die the way I want. Just because I am Nancy…"" Comments started pouring in after the singer posted this status. Though the reason or emotion behind this status is still unclear, Nancy seems to be upset regarding the prejudiced statements and judgmental attitudes of the society."

The film is directed by Iranian filmmaker Morteza Atashzamzam. The film, according to Ananta Jalil, had a budget of BDT 100 crores. Ananta, known to make 'impossible things possible', talks to The Daily Star about his film. How are the audience receiving the film? After the film's release, I have visited many halls, and seen the craze of the audience for ""Din- The Day"". It is much more than what we had expected. We are elated that our film is running at the highest number of halls not only in the capital, but in the entire country. Could you explain about the craze of the audience? The audience has loved the movie -- one hundred percent. There has been a scarcity for tickets, for the film. People are buying tickets in advance. I have never acted in any project which would leave my audience unentertained. I make movies so that people go to the cinema halls. I am successful in doing that. There has been an ongoing debate about the budget of the film. What is your take on that? Controversies cannot stop me from doing my job. I have invested for the shoots which took in Bangladesh, while the rest of the portion was carried by the Iranian producer. At the same time, no matter what people say, the film is genuinely budgeted at BDT 100 crore. How much would be your remuneration for acting in any other producer's film? So far, I have not worked for anyone else's movie. If I ever work in any project, I would not agree less than BDT 90 Lakh as my remuneration. Also, if Barsha signs any film, she will take BDT 30 Lakh. ""Din-The Day"" was supposed to have a screening where 74 celebrities from the film industry were invited. However, most of them did not appear. What was your reaction to it? I'm usually busy for business purposes; thus, I cannot keep up with the connection with everyone in the industry. They were invited on my behalf, and even I invited some of them personally. We expected their presence. However, they did not show up. It feels like we are calling the fraternity a family just for the sake of it. This made me upset for a while. Nonetheless, the love that the audience have been showering upon us made me forget everything else. Translated by Sharmin Joya"

""Hawa"" is slated for release on July 29.  Hashim Mahmud, the lyricist and composer of the song, has been in the news after the release of the song. However, he was not talked about in the media as often in the past. A year ago, another song by Mahmud, ""Tomay Ami Paite Pari Baazi"", went viral on social media.  Those who frequented Charukola in Dhaka University a few years ago would know this Hashim Mahmud. Director Mejbaur Rahman Sumon specifically selected Hashim Mahmud to work on his first film ""Hawa"".  Sumon told The Daily Star, ""I have known Hashim bhai since his Charukola days. I spent many afternoons enjoying his music. When I started working on 'Hawa', I decided that I wanted to keep one of his songs in the movie. However, I couldn't find Hashim bhai anymore, as he no longer frequented the fine arts department."" ""After searching for four months, I came to know that Hashim bhai was ill and that he was living in Narayanganj. I got the permission to use his song, however, as he was ill, Hashim bhai could not sing the version for the movie,"" said Sumon.  Talking about the story behind the song, Mejbaur Rahman Sumon disclosed some of the details, ""The singer of the song, Arfan Mredha Shiblu, has worked with Hashim Mahmud bhai for a long time. Shiblu shared with us that Hashim bhai told him the story of going to the Lalon Shah Mazaar in Kushtia and writing the song. There, he fell in love with a woman, who was as dark as a blackbird. It was to her that he couldn't express his feelings, during Boshonto."" ""We don't know if Hashim bhai told this story as a joke or seriously. The song 'Shada Shada Kala Kala"" did not use any musical instruments except khamak. The song was produced by Emon Choudhury using sounds of the boat's wood, bamboo, pots and pans—which took a long time. These unique instruments were played by And these instruments have been played by Mithun Chakra,"" added Sumon.  The story of ""Hawa"" revolves around 8 sailors who are mysteriously trapped on a fishing trawler in the middle of the sea.

The book not only carries a chronological history of the development of Bangladeshi band music, but also the authentic profiles of over 170 bands along with their discographies. Haque, now a senior journalist, and Milu, a full-fledged writer, have worked separately as music-journalists for many years. ‌With their combined experience, and almost two years of relentless effort, the duo will publish their book, ""Banglar Rock Metal"" on August 5. ‌Haque said that he has spent hours at the archive section of different libraries working on this book. The duo not only depended on the existing documents but also decided to record the oral history of living band members. ""We crosschecked the information with the former band members who are still alive. It was an arduous process, and we had to go above and beyond to track down and contact some of the musicians. Some of them have also been living in different parts of the world for decades now,"" said ‌Haque. ‌""For example, the members of the 90s band Aces now live abroad, scattered across different countries. They also found it difficult to recall their glory days, as it has been a very long time since they were in their prime. So, we created a group chat on social media, and gave them plenty of time to sit down and recall the decade-old memories,"" explained Milu. ""We followed their conversations from the group and noted down what one can call an almost erased histories,"" said the co-author. This book is being published by Aajob Prokash.

However, the venue has not been decided as of yet. ‌""Pre-orders are open till launching, but we have already received an overwhelming response from the 'band-music' fans. Currently, we are estimating that the first-print run of the book will be out of stock as soon it is launched,"" said Joy. ‌According to Joy, this book has enabled the nation to overcome the reluctant culture of not preserving and documenting our history in a proper manner. ""Banglar Rock Metal"" can be pre-ordered via the Facebook page of Aajob Prokash at a discounted price. ""As the price of the 450-page hardbound book will be around BDT 1000, it might cause students and young music-enthusiasts to struggle to buy the book. That is why we wanted to provide a discount for these fans during the pre-order campaign,"" added Joy. Ziaur Rahman Zia, band leader and bassist of Shironamhin said that this was a much-needed initiative, and that he is happy that someone took on the responsibility to give people an authentic record of the country's band-music history. ‌""The importance of archiving has always been relevant, and we're really fortunate that this talented duo, who witnessed the scene for almost four decades, successfully took this initiative,"" said Zia. ‌"

3075916,Yet another musical marvel from Meghdol,21-07-2022,/entertainment/music/news/yet-another-musical-marvel-meghdol-3075916,entertainment,"When I noticed that Meghdol had released a song for the film ""Hawa"", while scrolling through my YouTube homepage, I somehow knew that I would not be disappointed. Of course, this was a hunch owing to my eternal love for Meghdol. However, what I did not expect was to be moved by it to the extent that I was. It has been years since a piece of music managed to sincerely and deeply pull at my heartstrings to the level ""E Hawa"" has been able to. I did not have the best day and stayed in bed past twilight—I did not bother to get up and switch on the lights during Maghrib, the curtains remained drawn. I had already seen the music video for the song upon its release, but when I played the song this time, it hit me differently. As the soft music began, images of a beautiful teal sea—which I had witnessed just the day before in the music video—flooded my mind. Close shots of a boat rocking against the turbulent sea; two men sitting on it desolately. When the song picked up, the singer's voice reverberated through my room, and for a moment, it was almost like I was there with him on his voyage. There is an earthly quality in singer-songwriter Shibu Kumer Shill's voice, one that always managed to strike a chord with me. Meghdol's past songs, including the likes of ""Esho Amar Shohore"", ""Akash Meghe Dhaka"", ""Shohor Bondhi Megh"", and ""Na Bola Phul"", have always been my top picks in terms of Bangladeshi music. Now, ""E Hawa"" will also forever stay with me. Shill's velveteen voice urging this 'Hawa', pleading with her to disclose where she's taking him, is heart wrenching to hear. The way he implores her—whether it is the violent wind steering the rickety boat off course or the siren-like girl clad in a red saree—it almost compelled me to feel the distress behind the lyrics. The starting guitar solo, eventually going on to find the vocals and drums, creates yet another layer of sentiment and elevation to the composition. The heaviness of the instruments create a sublime combination to encapsulate what was going on the screen: the rumbling storm. The flute, clarinet, saxophone, along with the guitars and drums, all coming together to meet the vocalist, as his voice soared to a crescendo, leaving his baritone and becoming almost hollow—it felt as though I was, somehow, caught in the middle of that storm projected on the screen. The monochromatic fixtures of the ship swaying in the wind, flashes of blaring red light, it all came together to tug some profound and unfeigned emotion out of me. At that moment, it felt as though I could cry. I think I finally understand why people get so emotional during string quartet orchestras. Sitting in my small, dark room, I realise the power that a well composed piece of music can have on people. The song, in coming down from its peak, lulled me back into safety, away from the storm of emotions I felt all this time. This song is perhaps one of those rare, complete, and beautiful pieces of stories, that will surely stay with me forever. And even though I will always have so many things to say about it, I can never truly point out exactly why it spoke to me with so much meaning and heart."

None can delve deep into nature the way an artist can. When the unconditional offerings of nature mingle with the utmost sincerity of an artist, there happens a magic that we call art. Anurup Kanti Das is such a visual artist, who tries to capture the essence of nature in an aesthetic way that speaks through serenading nature's own songs. Taking photography as his forte, Anurup, who currently lives in Helsinki, Finland, blissfully roams around nature and creates an orchestration of images zooming in on the serenity of nature together—with human beings' in close proximity of it—indulging in the socio-cultural aspects of life, while sharing a nostalgic love affair with the city he lives in. John Keats's famous excerpt, ""A thing of beauty is joy forever…"" from the poem ""Ode to a Grecian Urn"" holds true, considering Anurup's dedication towards the visual arts. He went to many lengths and even had to withstand the shivering winter, to arrest the exquisite images of Helsinki. With several selected images, Anurup Kanti Das's maiden solo exhibition titled ""Whiteness of the North"" is being held at Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin Gallery of Zilla Shilpakala Academy, Chattogram, for the visual art lovers of the port city. Renowned poet and journalist Abul Momen inaugurated the exhibition as chief guest on July 21. The exhibition, opening daily from 4 pm to 8 pm, will conclude on July 23. The season 'Winter' has its unique beauty. Anurup marvelously captured the pristine beauty of nature in an array of images ranging from the snow-covered nature to the Finnish lifestyle, cultural nuances and nostalgia. The multi-award-winning artist also served as a photojournalist in Dainik Purbokone, Dainik Suprobhat Bangladesh and The Daily Star. Following his footprints in Helsinki, Finland, he had to quit his profession of photojournalism, but he never ceased to taking snaps. Even with his cell phone, he took beautiful images to satisfy his inner passion. The exhibit is an outcome of his cell-phone photography. The showcased images are well-composed with a detailed depiction of subjects, objects, perspectives, colour combinations and a soothing game of light and shade.     The changing courses of nature attract Anurup a lot. Here he has prominently portrayed the mysteries of winter. The solitary island nearing the Helsinki harbour is a great, visual delight. There remains a grave silence where snow has covered almost everything from the branches and leaves, to the surface of the roadside parks along with the chairs and walkways in it. The snow-covered cars, bikes and balconies appear to be unused for a long time. Yet, trams, cars and metro rails ply on the roads for the city dwellers. Human activity is rather limited during the season. The photographer waited for a long time to take the best images of humans' outdoor activity. Anurup Kanti Das wishes to take the ephemeral beauty of Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights for his next solo exhibition."

Monsur Choudhury, the trustee of ASWT, then took to the stage, speaking about the life and work, and vision of Abu Subhan. Abu Subhan, who always dreamt of becoming a painter, loved his surroundings dearly. He saw the struggles of tea estate workers, and decided to form a trust to help indigenous children fund their passion. Today, fifteen years after his demise, Abu Subhan's Trust, with six members, offers scholarships to fine arts students based on their merit and needs. Abu Subhan, being the only Bangladeshi fellow in the Royal Art Society of the UK, paved the way for indigenous youngsters to use their skills to their fullest potential. Abu Subhan was the CEO of Duncan Brothers in Bangladesh. His wife, Nasreen Subhan, carries the torch of ASWT on his behalf.   Lumbiny Dewan, a former artist and scholar of ASWT, spoke about the challenges of studying in an expensive city like Dhaka, especially for the ones who hail from remote areas with very limited resources. She thanked Abu Subhan and ASWT for their efforts. Renowned artist and sculptor Hamiduzzaman Khan attended the event as special guest. He expressed his admiration for Abu Subhan and praised the curator of this successful event, Kanak Chanpa Chakma. Her Excellency Nathalie Chuard, the ambassador of Switzerland in Bangladesh, said, indigenous cultures are important to protect the environment and her homeland always upholds the striving minority groups. Kanak Chanpa Chakma, a 'key artist of Rangamati' in Hamiduzzaman's opinion, talked spoke about the lack of resources and funds when it comes to promoting children to practice art. The formal programme concluded with a few cultural performances from the students of Camellia Duncan Foundation School. This was followed by the opening ceremony. The paintings portrayed several aspects of the indigenous communities in Bangladesh -- their livelihoods, culture and their artifacts. Artworks like ""Village"" and ""Allegory of Nature"" demonstrated the deep bond between nature and these suburb dwellers. The artist of 'Pena' used the seven prominent colors representing all the Manipuri communities of the world.

3074206,Portraying the bucolic beauty of Bangladesh  ,21-07-2022,/entertainment/theatre-arts/news/portraying-the-bucolic-beauty-bangladesh-3074206,entertainment,"Renowned artist Samar Majumder's third solo exhibition, titled 'Soul Searching: A Personal Journey' took place at the contemporary art gallery Shilpangan, Lalmatia in the capital. The month-long exhibition concludes tomorrow. The artist's singular style occupies time-honoured folk motifs and Bengali ballads. Throughout his entire life and artistic career, Samar Majumder persistently experiments with newer modes of expression - his compositions are natural in essence, as they relate to the soul, soil and the bucolic beauty of Bangladesh. He consciously takes his artistic muse and strength from human feelings and emotions.   Art lovers can easily connect his simplistic forms that engage his ideas in a dialectical exploration of metaphors, nuances and meanings. Yet, at the same time, they depict different expressive modes. Folk art has got a new lease of life, thanks to the dedicated creative efforts by the artist. He continues to experiment with the conventional folk motifs and creates his own works blending those with the touch of modernity.  Following the folk-traditions of Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin, Patua Quamrul Hassan, Safiuddin Ahmed, SM Sultan, Jamini Roy and other master artists, the prominent features in Samar's works include varied connotations of folk elements such as tepa putul, sora, nakshi kantha, design of homemade cake, jar, boat, bird, tree, river, fish, crop, flower, fruit, animal and the life sketches of rural people. Samar Majumder's compositions are bordered with free-flowing thick brush lines set on a thin layered colour background.  His sketches retain only the bare essentials, sometimes employing just a brief line to cover for a whole figure. Yet, they are immensely expressive. Mature hues and a lyrical colour balance are prominent features of his body of works.  Closely observing the lives of village people, artisans, farmers and the nature of rural Bangladesh, the artist has adeptly depicted common characters of pastoral Bangladesh. The 'rakhal' playing flute, fishermen's fishing in the river at night, house in coastal area, mother, angling whole day on a boat, framers' working in the field, village girl with her pet, girl with water lily and the musician are some of his prominent depictions for the ongoing exhibit.   His three-decade long career as an Assistant Chief Designer at BSCIC (Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation) helped him understand and support various artisans. At BSCIC, he also received mentorship from legendary artist Quamrul Hassan. He initially worked with textiles and tapestry, but his work allowed him to travel throughout the country where he got to know the lives of artisans and rural people. Samar Majumdar started painting in his early childhood. Later, he completed his academic studies from the Institute if Fine Arts, University of Dhaka in 1980. For the last four decades, he has been working on book cover designs and illustrations. He also garnered the best cover designer award from National Book Center six times."

3066871, ‘Beckoning Horizon’: Azmeer Hossain’s exhibition to run till July 23,08-07-2022,/entertainment/theatre-arts/news/beckoning-horizon-azmeer-hossains-exhibition-run-till-july-23-3066871,entertainment,"Azmeer Hossain's fifth solo exhibition ""Beckoning Horizon"" showcases sixty-two of his abstract and realistic paintings at the Edge Gallery in Gulshan. The exhibition features multiple series of abstract, objective and non-objective paintings by the artist such as ""Horizon"", ""Memory"", ""Fragment"", ""My Journey"", ""Mindscape"", and ""Before Time"". Initially, the exhibition began on June 18 and is now set to be available at the gallery till July 23. ""Normally whenever we think about the horizon, we look as far as our vision can comprehend,"" said Azmeer Hossain. ""However, I cannot help but wonder what's beyond that. Every painting in this exhibition embodies the horizons of my mind, accumulating over my experience with nature, life, and my imagination."" Every painting in this exhibition expresses a unique sensation through the use of space and dimensions as if to give the viewers an insightful look towards the infinite horizon trapped in the canvas. ""Azmeer sir's work has always been fascinating as they represent so much more than what meets the eye,"" says Sanjida Sultana, a school teacher and passionate artist. ""His efforts and thoughts are apparent in his art. No wonder his paintings take months or even years to complete."" Taking a closer look, viewers may notice the vast multitude of layers used to perfectly portray the space between the subjects in the paintings in such a way so that it seamlessly mirrors reality. ""In our daily life we are living in a city that is filled with diversified textures, noises, forms, colours, sounds and smells,"" said renowned artist Syed Golam Dastagir. ""This chaotic and packed city is where Azmeer was born and brought up, and this has greatly influenced his art."" Watercolour has been a traditional medium in Bangladeshi art, dating from the Pala to Mughal eras. However, this particular type of watercolour was of an opaque quality. Later on, the British era introduced a new type of watercolour that belonged to the British impressionist school, which is transparent in nature. Azmeer Hossain is well known for his mastery over the use of watercolours. ""We are learning a lot about art every day. Yet, I feel the methods we use to create art should be equally researched,"" said the artist. After almost twenty-five years of studying and research, Azmeer Hossain came up with his own unique way of using watercolours. ""Suppose a buffalo stands before a tree. There is an obvious gap between the two subjects in reality, yet watercolour painting methods would not be able to express that gap in the canvas."" ""Over the years, I have developed my own way to remedy these flaws of watercolour,"" mentions Azmeer Hossain. ""This particular way of using watercolour has become my signature style."" ""In the future, I am hoping to spread my knowledge on watercolours to the next generation of artists,"" concluded Azmeer Hossain."
